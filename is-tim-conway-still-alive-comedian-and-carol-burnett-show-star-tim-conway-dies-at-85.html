He passed away on May 14, 2019, at the age of 85 due to complications arising from his ongoing brain condition. Conway was diagnosed with dementia caused by normal pressure hydrocephalus. He was famous for his roles in “The Carol Burnett Show” and as Ensign Charles Parker in the sitcom “McHale’s Navy.” In addition, he lent his voice to the character of Barnacle Boy in the animated TV series “SpongeBob SquarePants.” Conway was married to Charlene Fusco and is survived by his wife and six children from his previous marriage to Mary Anne Dalton.</p><h2 id=how_old_was_tim_conway_when_he_died class=smooth-goto>How old was Tim Conway when he died?</h2><p>Tim Conway, 85, best known for his notable work on “The Carol Burnett Show,” passed away on Tuesday morning in Los Angeles at the age of 85, as confirmed by his representative, Howard Bragman, to the Los Angeles Times. Conway had been residing in a long-term-care facility and suffered complications from hydrocephalus, a brain condition, and was also diagnosed with dementia. Carol Burnett expressed her heartbreak over Conway’s death in a statement to the Times, stating that he was a unique individual, both as a brilliant comedian and a kind-hearted person. She cherished the moments they shared together, both on and off the screen, and will always hold him close to her heart.</p><h2 id=professional_career_of_tim_conway class=smooth-goto>Professional career of Tim Conway&nbsp;</h2><p>After serving in the Army, Tim Conway went back to Cleveland and teamed up with Ernie Anderson on KYW-TV, an NBC affiliate, in 1958 and 1959. He then worked for WJW-TV, a CBS affiliate from 1960 to 1962, where he appeared in a weekday morning film show called Ernie’s Place, and wrote materials for comic skits during film intermissions. Conway and Anderson also collaborated on a comedy album during this time. However, WJW-TV dismissed Conway in 1962 for misleading management about his experience as a director, which resulted in Anderson hosting a horror film show on Friday nights instead. Conway continued to appear on Cleveland television periodically after becoming famous, including on the Hoolihan and Big Chuck and Big Chuck and Lil’ John shows on WJW-TV. He also made guest appearances at various “Ghoulardifest” events, along with other Cleveland TV personalities in tribute to Ernie Anderson, who passed away in 1997.</p><h2 id=biography_of_tim_conway class=smooth-goto>Biography of Tim Conway&nbsp;</h2><table cellspacing=0><tbody readability=11.5><tr><td><strong>SPECIFICATIONS&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>DETAILS&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Born</td><td>Thomas Daniel Conway<p>December 15, 1933</p><p>Willoughby, Ohio, U.S.</p></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Died</td><td readability=7>May 14, 2019 (aged 85)<p>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</p></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Resting place</td><td>Westwood Village Memorial Park, Westwood, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Other names</td><td>Tim Daniel Conway<p>Thomas Conway</p><p>Toma Daniel Conway</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Alma mater</td><td>Bowling Green State University</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Occupations</td><td><ul><li><p>Actor</p></li><li><p>comedian</p></li><li><p>writer</p></li><li><p>director</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouses</td><td readability=5>Mary Anne Dalton -​(m. 1961; div. 1978)​<p>Charlene Fusco Del Sardo Beatty –<br>​(m. 1984)​</p></td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
