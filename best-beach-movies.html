While seeing a beach-themed movie can make you worry that you’ll need a bigger boat, these movies are carefully chosen to capture the spirit of a beach getaway and entice us to jump back in the sea and ride off into the distance. The most comfortable aspect of it is that you can enjoy all of these from the comfort of your couch without the need for summer body. Look into these ten beach-themed <a href=#>books</a> for the ideal quick getaways.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> 50 First Dates</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Blue Hawaii</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Blue Lagoon</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Just Go With It</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Mamma Mia!</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Point Break</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> The Endless Summer</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> The Odyssey</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a></li></ul><h3><span id=50_First_Dates>50 First Dates<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/50-First-Dates-1.jpg alt="best beach movies on netflix,romantic beach movies,new beach movies,beach movies 2000s,beach romance movies on netflix,scary beach movies,movies about summer vacation,beach comedy movies,summer beach movies,80s beach movies,best beach movies on amazon prime,best beach movies ever,best beach movies on hulu,best beach movies hollywood,best beach movies reddit,best beach movies 1960s,best beach movies 2022,best beach movies imdb,best summer beach movies,best 60s beach movies,best 80s beach movies,best california beach movies,best family beach movies,best romantic beach movies,best adam beach movies,best scary beach movies,best 70s beach movies,best australian beach movies" width=1400 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p><a href=#>Adam Sandler</a> has frequently used Hawaii as the backdrop for his <a href=#>romantic comedies</a> since it is such a breathtakingly gorgeous location. Unusually, Henry (Sandler) falls for local artist Lucy (Drew Barrymore), but he soon learns that she suffers from a unique form of amnesia that makes her forget him every time she goes to sleep. With every new day, he tries to charm her once more. The plot makes the most of its gorgeous background by having a lot of the action take place outside. For example, when Henry plans ways to stop Lucy on the road, the rolling hills are displayed. Lucy’s important amnesia revelation scene is even placed at the end of a long pier. The movie makes sure that the Hawaiian setting will be enduring.</p><h3><span id=Blue_Hawaii>Blue Hawaii</span></h3><p>Blue Hawaii offers all the beach vacation amenities you could possibly need, including romance, music, whimsy, sun, surf, and sandy beaches. Elvis’ vacation was enjoyed by the audience, and the movie was so well-liked that many of his later productions used the same formula (putting Elvis in an exotic setting, then heaping on romance and <a href=#>songs</a> till the joyful ending), but none of them were as successful as Blue Hawaii. Thanks to the classic ballad “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” Elvis Presley’s most financially successful film also included his most popular soundtrack.</p><h3><span id=Blue_Lagoon>Blue Lagoon<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blue-Lagoon-1.jpg alt="best beach movies on netflix,romantic beach movies,new beach movies,beach movies 2000s,beach romance movies on netflix,scary beach movies,movies about summer vacation,beach comedy movies,summer beach movies,80s beach movies,best beach movies on amazon prime,best beach movies ever,best beach movies on hulu,best beach movies hollywood,best beach movies reddit,best beach movies 1960s,best beach movies 2022,best beach movies imdb,best summer beach movies,best 60s beach movies,best 80s beach movies,best california beach movies,best family beach movies,best romantic beach movies,best adam beach movies,best scary beach movies,best 70s beach movies,best australian beach movies" width=1500 height=807 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Two young children (Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins) are abandoned on a lush tropical island when their ship sinks. The kids are forced to deal with surviving the island, a nearby cannibal clan, and their own developing emotional and sexual relationships for one another as the years go by. Even though the movie received poor reviews, it was a great commercial hit and one of the highest-grossing movies of 1980. Be cautious while eating any crimson berries since the beautiful Fijian landscape and the (debatably sensual) underwater pictures will make you yearn for your own private beach getaway.</p><h3><span id=Forgetting_Sarah_Marshall>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</span></h3><p>After heartisted by booking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking heartisted by taking he (Russell Brand). Thankfully, he is saved by Rachel, a hotel employee (Mila Kunis), who at first feels sorry for him until affections start to grow. Forgetting Sarah Marshall serves as a reminder of how significantly a holiday can improve your life. It is sincere, sweet, and humorous.</p><h3><span id=Just_Go_With_It>Just Go With It</span></h3><p>A dishonest boss and a youngster who won’t bargain are all you need to get an all-expenses paid trip to Hawaii. In the surprisingly funny Just Go With It, Katherine (<a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>) and Danny (Adam Sandler) wind up on a lavish Hawaiian vacation. The movie is carefree, lighthearted, and enjoyable like a summer vacation; it is only made all the more alluring by its supporting cast, which includes Nicole Kidman, Brooklyn Decker, and the breathtaking Hawaii scenery. Never before had the deep pools of water next to a tumbling waterfall appeared so alluring.</p><h3><span id=Mamma_Mia>Mamma Mia!</span></h3><p>Mamma Mia! uses the hits of ABBA to tell the story of Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) attempting to discover which of the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård, Colin Firth) her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had a relationship with is her father, in order to have the right man give her away at her upcoming wedding. With its joyful attitude, sun-kissed cheeks, and amazing variety of musical performances, the film is a campy classic that brilliantly utilises the magnificent setting of the Greek Islands. If you’ve ever fantasised of having a destination wedding, this movie will remind you of the heady fizz of a glass of champagne.</p><h3><span id=Point_Break>Point Break<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Point-Break-1.jpg alt="best beach movies on netflix,romantic beach movies,new beach movies,beach movies 2000s,beach romance movies on netflix,scary beach movies,movies about summer vacation,beach comedy movies,summer beach movies,80s beach movies,best beach movies on amazon prime,best beach movies ever,best beach movies on hulu,best beach movies hollywood,best beach movies reddit,best beach movies 1960s,best beach movies 2022,best beach movies imdb,best summer beach movies,best 60s beach movies,best 80s beach movies,best california beach movies,best family beach movies,best romantic beach movies,best adam beach movies,best scary beach movies,best 70s beach movies,best australian beach movies" width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Sometimes a beach vacations at the beach can be an a beach vacation occasionally entail a beach vacation entail a beach towel vegging on a beach towel veg outing on a beach towel veg lounging on It can also be an action-packed adventure, much like the enormously enjoyable Point Break. Thanks to his developing relationship with Tyler, Utah infiltrates a surfing club commanded by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) by pretending to be surfers (Lori Petty). The spectator is given a front-row seat to skydiving, bank heists, shoot-outs, and some seriously brutal surfing in each scene, which is more action-packed than the last. Kathryn Bigelow’s picture is magnificently filmed and has gained cult status, possibly as a result of its distinctive aesthetic as a female-gaze action movie or its so-bad-it’s-good dialogue.</p><h3><span id=The_Endless_Summer>The Endless Summer<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Endless-Summer-1.jpg alt="best beach movies on netflix,romantic beach movies,new beach movies,beach movies 2000s,beach romance movies on netflix,scary beach movies,movies about summer vacation,beach comedy movies,summer beach movies,80s beach movies,best beach movies on amazon prime,best beach movies ever,best beach movies on hulu,best beach movies hollywood,best beach movies reddit,best beach movies 1960s,best beach movies 2022,best beach movies imdb,best summer beach movies,best 60s beach movies,best 80s beach movies,best california beach movies,best family beach movies,best romantic beach movies,best adam beach movies,best scary beach movies,best 70s beach movies,best australian beach movies" width=1000 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The Endless Summer, a groundbreaking surfing documentary shot on location all <a href=#>around the world</a>, will make you appreciate how stunning the world can be. They had no idea the wanderlust their film would arouse when filmmaker Bruce Brown, surfers Robert August and Michael Hynson, and they ventured off in 1966 in search of warm seas and the ideal wave. After more than 50 years, viewers are still tempted to give up their regular lives and pursue a life filled with wonder, adventure, sand, surf, and sun.</p><h3><span id=The_Odyssey><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Odyssey-1.jpg alt="best beach movies on netflix,romantic beach movies,new beach movies,beach movies 2000s,beach romance movies on netflix,scary beach movies,movies about summer vacation,beach comedy movies,summer beach movies,80s beach movies,best beach movies on amazon prime,best beach movies ever,best beach movies on hulu,best beach movies hollywood,best beach movies reddit,best beach movies 1960s,best beach movies 2022,best beach movies imdb,best summer beach movies,best 60s beach movies,best 80s beach movies,best california beach movies,best family beach movies,best romantic beach movies,best adam beach movies,best scary beach movies,best 70s beach movies,best australian beach movies" width=1500 height=844 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The Odyssey</span></h3><p>The beach offers activities beyond surfing, tanning, and drinking cocktails. The Odyssey, a <a href=#>biopic</a> of renowned French director, researcher, scientist, and diver Jacques Cousteau, will transport you to a subaquatic world. Cousteau was a champion of investigating the depths of the ocean and bringing the dark secrets of the sea into the living rooms of his audience. He was a clear inspiration for filmmakers like Wes Anderson and James Cameron. You will be enticed to take up a scuba mask and explore the undersea world on your own after watching the film because it has some beautiful underwater imagery.</p><h3><span id=The_Sisterhood_of_the_Traveling_Pants>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</span></h3><p>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants will make you nostalgic for the days of carefree summer vacations with your buddies. With Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) staying home, Carmen (America Ferrera) visiting South Carolina, Bridget (Blake Lively) visiting Baja California in Mexico, and Lena (Alexis Bledel) taking a plane to the Greek island of Santorini, this movie has the advantage of examining four separate vacations. Santorini is a sea of white and blue houses accentuated with vibrant flowers, surrounded by smooth sand, and beautiful ocean; it is possibly even more wonderful than a pair of jeans that fit four adolescent girls of varying sizes. Even if the locations aren’t your cup of tea, the touching tale of four friends who support one another through all of life’s ups and downs will make you feel good inside.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="best beach movies on netflix,romantic beach movies,new beach movies,beach movies 2000s,beach romance movies on netflix,scary beach movies,movies about summer vacation,beach comedy movies,summer beach movies,80s beach movies,best beach movies on amazon prime,best beach movies ever,best beach movies on hulu,best beach movies hollywood,best beach movies reddit,best beach movies 1960s,best beach movies 2022,best beach movies imdb,best summer beach movies,best 60s beach movies,best 80s beach movies,best california beach movies,best family beach movies,best romantic beach movies,best adam beach movies,best scary beach movies,best 70s beach movies,best australian beach movies" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
