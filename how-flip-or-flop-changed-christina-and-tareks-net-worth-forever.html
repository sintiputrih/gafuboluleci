Of course, that shouldn’t surprise anyone since HGTV is different than other TV networks because many of its viewers are very loyal to it. In fact, many of its viewers care so much about the network that they want to know <a href=#>the secrets about the top HGTV shows</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Lauren Risley Before She Landed Her HGTV Series 'Call The Closer'?</a></span></p><p>On top of Flip or Flop becoming a hit because it aired on HGTV, there also is no denying that series stars Tarek El Moussa and Christina Hall played a major role in its success. After all, many fans really liked the couple a lot and were saddened to learn that<a href=#> something had gone wrong in Christina and Tarek’s marriage</a> which resulted in them getting divorced. On the bright side, there is no doubt that Flip or Flop made a fortune for Tarek and Christina but the question remains how much did the show change their net worths?</p><h2 id=how-much-money-are-christina-hall-and-tarek-el-moussa-from-flip-or-flop-worth>How Much Money Are Christina Hall And Tarek El Moussa From Flip Or Flop Worth?</h2><p>For most HGTV fans, there is no doubt that Christina Hall and Tarek El Moussa will always be associated in their minds. However, that doesn’t mean that each of them has enjoyed the same level of success as each other. Of course, it should go without saying that Christina and Tarek are both very wealthy and successful. However, the truth of the matter is that Tarek isn’t quite as successful as his ex-wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Tarek El Moussa And Heather Rae Young Went Over Budget For Their Wedding</a></span></p><p>Best known as one of Flip or Flop’s two hosts, Tarek El Moussa hosted that show for ten seasons from 2013 until 2022. From there, Tarek went on to host other shows including Brother vs. Brother and more recently Flipping 101 with Tarek El Moussa. On top of Tarek’s television efforts, he also is the author of the self-help book “Flip Your Life: Turning Obstacles Into Opportunities — No Matter What Comes Your Way”. Thanks to all of those efforts, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarek currently has a $15 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like her ex-husband, <a href=#>Christina Hall has been very busy making a lot of money</a> for years. For example, Christina has hosted several shows alongside Tarek including Flip or Flop and Brother vs. Brother. More recently, Christina has hosted the shows Christina on the Coast, Christina: Stronger by Design, and Christina in the Country on her own. Also a published author, Christina has authored a self-help book as well as a diet and cookbook. According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina now has a $25 million fortune</a>.</p><h2 id=how-much-flip-or-flop-changed-christina-and-tarek-rsquo-s-net-worth-forever>How Much Flip Or Flop Changed Christina and Tarek’s Net Worth Forever</h2><p>In March of 2022, it was announced that Flip or Flop was ending after ten seasons of the hit show aired on HGTV. To say that the announcement disappointed the show’s loyal fans who’d been consistently watching for years is a huge understatement. After all, HGTV canceling Flip or Flop felt like it came out of nowhere for many of the show's fans as it was announced the series was ending, and then the finale aired only eight days later.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Flip Or Flop' Tarek El Moussa Allegedly Loses His Cool On Ex Wife Christina Haack On Set</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time Flip or Flop’s finale aired, the show’s stars had been famous for many, many years. As a result, it may be easy for many of Christina and Tarek’s fans to forget what led to the two of them becoming famous in the first place. After all, before Flip or Flop turned Tarek and Christina into celebrities, they were real estate agents with no plans to become TV stars.</p><p>In 2008, millions of people suddenly found themselves in dire straits after the real estate market crashed and they were left with mortgages they couldn’t afford. On top of that home buyers who were in trouble, many real estate agents suddenly found themselves in a horrible financial situation as a result of the crash as well. For example, as Tarek El Moussa and Christina Hall have revealed that following the crash, they lost their home and began renting a $700 per month apartment since that is all they could afford.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an attempt to make ends meet, Christina Hall and Tarek El Moussa decided to begin flipping houses in California. In a stroke of genius, Tarek had one of his friends film the process of the couple flipping a house and then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sent in an audition tape to HGTV</a>. Clearly charmed by Christina and Tarek’s presence and chemistry on camera, HGTV hired them to host Flip or Flop and the rest is history.</p><p>Based on what is known about how Christina Hall and Tarek El Moussa became the hosts of Flip or Flop, it is clear that they were in a perilous financial situation at the time. With that in mind, it is very clear that Tarek and Christina owe their fortunes to Flip or Flop. After all, even though both of them have earned part of their fortunes from books and other shows, they only got those opportunities after Flip or Flop turned them into TV stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Christina Haack's New Husband?
