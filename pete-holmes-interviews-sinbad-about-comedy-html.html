But there is another kind of influence that is just as important, the immensely popular kind that happens to correspond with a comedian-to-be’s childhood. Sinbad, who had a run of superstardom in the early and mid-’90s, is one of those comedians, and Pete Holmes, host of <i>The Pete Holmes Show</i> on TBS and the “You Made It Weird” podcast, was one such young comedy fan. With Sinbad’s new special, <i>Makes Me Wanna Holla</i>, debuting on Comedy Central tomorrow night, Vulture arranged for the pair to tape an episode of “You Made It Weird.” Running nearly two hours, we have excerpted and edited down a small section. Check the <a href=#>“You Made It Weird” page</a> in the coming weeks to download and hear the full interview.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-3-0-0@published data-word-count=10><b>You’ve been doing comedy for …<br></b><span>30 years. 30 years man.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-4-0-0@published data-word-count=21><b>Here’s what’s crazy, I was gonna say that’s how old I am.

They can’t get into the Improv unless you become a big name, but how do you become a name? You gotta be working. I think back in the day, when there were so many comedy clubs. When I was coming up, you had a chance to work a lot. And you worked, and you worked, and you worked, so you could find your spot. Now where do you work at? Where’s a comic work on the road?

So when I became a comic, I already had these world experiences. I wasn’t some kid, 17, trying to make stuff up. So when I went onstage, I was in Kansas City and the guy said, “Just do two or three minutes. If you can’t do two or three minutes, just do what you can do.” I said, “Who can’t do three minutes?” I walked onstage, and you know what I did?

I’mma do it clean. But I’ll push it to the edge.” So I didn’t call it clean; I just called it comedy. When I got done, cats said, “Did he cuss? I think he did.” That’s what I wanted. They didn’t know if I did or not. It wasn’t until I got to Hollywood that I got so caught up in, “Are you a clean comic? Are you a dirty comic? Oh, he’s an all-American comic; oh, he’s squeaky clean.” I just said, “Y’all put me in a box that I have to always fight to get out of.”<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-28-0-0@published data-word-count=51>It was almost like, if you talked a certain way, you really were that way.

This has to hit now.” It’s being bold as hell. I heard Jay Leno would give comedy clubs $100 and say, “If it ain’t funny, keep it.” I stole that.

I’d do a minute. I’d have to get a laugh in the first four seconds, and that laugh can’t stop. I would see club owners come out the back, “Is that that kid?” I’d come offstage and the other comic would go, “Damn, dude, give him a hand. I don’t know what that was about.”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-38-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>Were you improvising at that point?<br></b><span>Yes!</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-39-0-0@published data-word-count=30><b>You … that’s not fair!<br></b><span>One comic dogged me.

Last place, and they all said, “Man, you’ll never make it. You’re doing Richard Pryor jokes.” He said, “I’ll be famous next year and you’ll be here next year.” And it happened. He was famous on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and they were all doing the competition next year because he knew who he was.

I showed up in town and Boston clubs were so cool. This is back in the heyday of Boston, ‘83 or ‘84. They gave me their gigs.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-47-0-0@published data-word-count=19><b>Lenny Clark and all those guys?<br></b><span>Yeah, Lenny Clark. “Come here!” Lenny and his brother gave me gigs.

I don’t wanna be here. I hate these guys.” It’s a senior citizens’ home.” And every comic came onstage, “Oh, you deaf? Can you hear me? You deaf? You can’t hear me?” So I walked onstage and said, “Y’all have orgies every night, don’t you?” They just flipped. I said, “Everybody thinks y’all are old and don’t wanna do stuff. You’re old and your knees hurt. Your backs hurt. But otherwise you’re trying to hang, ain’t you?” I said, “Who’s the pimp here?” And all the women pointed at this one guy. He was the dude!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ac0a7ff917265e02911cd0a9705b8bb7-50-0-0@published data-word-count=92>I’m talking to this guy the whole night and I said, “Man, you haven’t cracked a smile yet.” And his wife said, “He’s deaf.” And comics were like, “Oh, how’s he gonna get him?” He wasn’t totally deaf, but he turned his hearing-aid down. I said well, “He’s a blessed man because he doesn’t have to hear what you’ve got to say to him.” She fell out. She told him, he fell <i>out</i>. &nbsp;I reached down in the pit of my stomach because I had nowhere to go.
