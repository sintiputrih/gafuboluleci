He also reported child support debts to the tune of $1.24 million.

DMX was said to owe $1.7 million, and he spent a year in prison because of it.&nbsp;</p><p>He was released in January 2019 but still owed $2.3 million to the IRS at that time. The government made plans to garnish DMX's income until the debt was paid off.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And that’s after Jay-Z cleared $12 million of debt for DMX.</h2><p>DMX received a big financial break in the mid-2000s, when fellow rapper <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> pardoned him from an estimated $12 million of debt as he left Def Jam Recordings.</p><p>“The good part about Def Jam — and I gotta give it to Hov — X was in debt over there.
