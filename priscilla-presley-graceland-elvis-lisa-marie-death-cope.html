You really do. When I walk in, it's like wow. It's like the memories are there and all, but I do feel his spirit there. I truly feel his spirit there.”</p><p>Looking emotional and smiling she added: “Listen, Graceland is my heart. I love Graceland. I love going. It's like I never left.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whenever I go there, I feel it's still my home too.&nbsp;</p><p>“I get memories like you can't believe the kitchen, the dining room table.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“And when I walk in and see that dining room table, I can see us all sitting there and laughing and watching Johnny Carson show and having just group talks with him.</p><p>“And of course, there were the guys too. So Graceland is very special.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was special to him, special to me. I think when people go there to visit, you feel it.”</p><p>Fans applauded her comments as she spoke at An Evening With Priscilla Presley at the South Point Casino in <a href=#>Las Vegas</a>, emceed by Hotel entertainment director Michael Libonati.</p><p>It’s the first time she has publicly acknowledged her fight to be laid to rest with her late husband.</p><p>In August, court documents confirmed that Riley and her lawyers had agreed to her request after several months of fighting following heiress Lisa Marie’s death in January.</p><p>The papers noted: “To the extent of her authority, Riley agrees to allow Priscilla to be buried upon her death in the Meditation Garden of Graceland.</p><p>“The burial location will be at the location closest to <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> without moving any existing gravesite.”</p><p>Elvis’s burial plot sits beside his mother Gladys and father Vernon.&nbsp;<br>Lisa Marie, his only child, was laid to rest, beside her son <a href=#>Benjamin Keough</a>, who died in 2020.</p><p>Presley also revealed during the intimate evening of recollections about her career and relationship with Elvis, that one room in Graceland is unique and “holds a place in her heart”.</p><p>“It's grandma's room because grandma was there sitting in her chair watching TV by herself.&nbsp;</p><p>“She would tell me stories about Elvis when he was younger, about Gladys, about Vernon, and I cherished those times so much.</p><p>&nbsp;“She was a wonderful human being, just so authentic. And that's where Elvis's favorite place was too.</p><p>“Before we'd go to the movies, he'd sit on the bed across from her rocking chair and I'd sit in the chair <span id=098ad510-3303-45cb-b934-1f3575ee889f class=suggested-link>next</span> to her and we would make her laugh.</p><p>“And she had no <span id=07f4748b-7acb-4054-ade5-f50cd42b60b4 class=suggested-link>teeth</span> and she'd chew tobacco and she'd hold that tobacco and Elvis would say, 'grandma, you can't be chewing that tobacco around people’; and she goes, ‘son, I can do anything I want.’&nbsp;</p><p>“She was so bossy with him and so full of life. Grandma's room was where the two of us spent to a lot of our time.”</p><p>This week Variety reported &nbsp;Lisa Marie was horrified by the storyline of her dad in <span id=9b882218-2de3-49be-b922-20f58c3b45d4 class=suggested-link>the script</span> for <a href=#>Sofia Coppola</a>’s new <span id=f386b9bb-d1f4-4ce4-a10d-fbc19df83c50 class=suggested-link>film</span> Priscilla.</p><p>She fired off emails obtained asking Coppola to “reconsider her vision for the character and to spare her <span id=959e0ba7-7133-4407-b0c3-a828bcadbc13 class=suggested-link>family</span> public embarrassment.”</p><p>The messages were sent four months before Presley <a href=#>suffered a fatal cardiac arrest</a> in January.&nbsp;</p><p>Priscilla avoided that film controversy but felt that watching actress Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla was “like watching myself on screen.”</p><p>Looking somber, Priscilla spoke of her grief for her daughter, &nbsp;who died of a bowel obstruction caused by weight-loss surgery she underwent several years ago.</p><p>Looking down, she said: “I’m coping. I don’t know.</p><p>“I am doing okay every day it gets a little bit better... not fully.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't think I'll ever get over it, but I'm trying really hard. And this is good for me, to be honest with you. It gets me out of my life, my thoughts, and being alone.</p><p>“This is good, talking and sharing and listening.”</p><p>Priscilla did not mention Riley at all but did have a family moment on stage before the end of her 80-minute appearance.</p><p>The audience clapped wildly as she announced: “My son is here tonight.”</p><p>When Navarone walked out, he stated: “Hello Mother.&nbsp;This is the first time I've ever come to her shows before. I wanted to see everybody react to see my mother.”</p><p>The pair then joked around on stage with him asking: “What was your thoughts when I decided that I was going to get into the music business?”</p><p>Laughing Priscilla replied: “You've never asked me that before. Wow.”</p><p>He fired back: “She truly, really only listens to the old stuff she really most listens to. I try to play her everything that I feel has emotion, everything that I feel, and I try to sing the words along. so she feels the words.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“She really just doesn't get into it.”</p><p>Shocked Priscilla reacted: “What you talking about? That's not true.”<br>Navarone responded: “You like it half the time. We have different tastes.”<figure class=article__media></figure></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/photo-magma-agency-wireimage-850540717.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/r9p17r-elvis-presley-priscilla-presley-833236718.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZWt%2FcYCXaKeroaOYtq24wGanq52jobK6ecarmJydnJa7pXnEpa2iq12htrStjKaYq6GVYrGmrdOhZJynoJp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./riots-in-new-york.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Moments That Shook The City To Its Core">&larr;
