Similarly, she presently works as a manager for her spouse after marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides working as a golf manager for her husband, she runs her father’s company. Granado has a proven track record of achievement. She’s bringing up her spouse Gary throughout the conversation. As a result, Gary has become a full-fledged golfer. He was a non-stop basketball player in high school before switching to golf. He took his first foray into golf when he was a <a href=#>college</a> student.</p><p>After a sudden-death playoff with Chez Revie, Woodland won his third PGA Tour tournament in 2018 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. The PGA Championship in 2018 saw him hold the lead after 36 holes with a score of 120. A record-setting two-game win streak was established in the early stages of the championship event.</p><p>Furthermore, last year, Woodland had a commanding lead at Kapalua, Hawaii, entering the final round of the winner-only-sent tournament of Champions.

Despite all of this, she has yet to reveal the entire extent of her business and financial resources. She also has a net worth of $14 million because of her golfer husband, Gary.
