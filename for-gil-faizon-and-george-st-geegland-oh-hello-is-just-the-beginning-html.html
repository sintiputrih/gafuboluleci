And it makes sense – the theatrical experience is hard to capture, and long-running shows are wary of cutting into ticket profits. But for a limited-run show, particularly one starring comedians with a fanbase that extends far beyond the typical New York theater crowd, a wide release makes perfect sense. In May, Chris Gethard brought his off-Broadway show </span><a href=#><i><span style=font-weight:400>Career Suicide</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400> to HBO, and today one of the biggest draws of the past Broadway season, Nick Kroll and John Mulaney’s </span><a href=#><i><span style=font-weight:400>Oh, Hello</span></i></a><i><span style=font-weight:400>,</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> comes to Netflix. Yesterday, I joined a roundtable discussion with the stars to talk about the evolution of the show, what’s next for </span><span style=font-weight:400>Gil Faizon</span><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><span style=font-weight:400>George St. Geegland</span><span style=font-weight:400>, and, of course, tuna.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3tbvb0g1fyamcma03hkp6@published data-word-count=57><b>Journalist 1: We were talking about how we’ve each seen the show in various forms, either seeing it off-Broadway, I saw it when it was traveling in Boston, and then seeing what it’s turned into and the version on Netflix.

And we were like, “This is working on this level and certain things about New York are universal.” People just know what New York is from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Seinfeld </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese.
