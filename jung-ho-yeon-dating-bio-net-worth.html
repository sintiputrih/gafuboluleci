She has been dating her senior actor, Lee Dong Hwi, since 2016, who is mainly known for his works in the second highest-grossing South Korean film in history, The Handmaiden and Extreme Job. She said, <strong>“Since he’s also an actor, he’s a good senior, a good friend, and a good person. He cheers me on a lot, and he worries for me as well. He’s sort of like a dad."</strong></span></p><p><span>Her boyfriend, Lee Dong Hwi, is famous for his popular drama Reply 1997 that also starred in Girl’s Day’s Hyeri, Park Bo Gum, Ryu Jun Yeol, and more. She even shared how her boyfriend has been amazing and supportive as not only her boyfriend but also a sunbae (senior) and friend.</span></p><p><span>The couple has an age gap of 9 years, and it was tough for them to manage a relationship, but nevertheless, many people are supportive of their relationship as they’re perfect for each other. Their fans have also nicknamed them as <strong>‘fashionista couple.’</strong> They have been dating for almost six years now and are still going strong.</span></p><p><span>When their relationship was officially publicized, many reports claimed both of them had free personalities and were not afraid to hide their affection. Their relationship was not an open secret in the industries, and her boyfriend’s agency confirmed the news releasing statement that said, <strong>“After checking in personally with the parties involved, it is true that Lee Dong Hwi and Jung Ho Yeon are dating. As it is his personal life, we don’t know the details, but they are in a good relationship. Please watch over them.”</strong></span></p><h2><span><strong>Jung Ho Yeon Bio</strong></span></h2><p><span>Jung Ho Yeon is a South Korean model and rookie actress aged 27 years old as she was born in 1994. She celebrates her birthday on 23 June every year.</span></p><p><span>She starred in Netflix’s Squid Game, which&nbsp;became the most streamed show in 90 countries, making it one of the most popular Netflix shows. It was her first acting role in Squid Game.</span></p><p><span><strong>YOU MAY LIKE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Squid Game's Park Hae Soo?

She was in New York Fashion Week at the time and eventually got cast. She explained that she was happy and felt as if a greater fear had taken over her.</span></p><p><span>She has talked about how her role, Kang Sae Byeok, is similar to her in real life, facing all the loneliness. She said,<strong> “In 2016, I left Korea to further my modeling career overseas, and I spent a lot of time alone. At the time, the emotion that I felt the most was loneliness … That feeling of loneliness while trying to persevere and live isn’t all that different.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Vogue even dubs Jung Ho Yeon as “Korea’s Next top model,” who started modeling since she was 16 without an agent. Then she signed to Esteem Models and appeared on Korea’s Next top model for public exposure and eventually got featured in high-level magazines such as Vogue Girl Korea, Nylon Korea, and ELLE Wedding. The model-turned-actress has a height of 1.77 m and is known for her fiery personality.</span></p><p><span>The model is friends with the South Korean girl group Blackpink’s main rapper and main vocalist, Jennie, who showed up in the sets of Squid Game to show her support for her friend.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Jung Ho Yeon</strong></span></h2><p><span>The rookie actress Jung Ho Yeon, with a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $1 million, has become the South Korean actress with the highest number of Instagram followers after the success of her first role in the drama series Squid Game. The actress overtook famous South Korean actresses such as Song Hye Ko (12 million followers). Soon, she surpassed another model turned actress Lee Sung Kyung(12.9 million followers), having 13.8 million Instagram followers.</span></p><p><span>Jung Ho Yeon played the most incredible character in the Squid Game drama and became the No.1 favorite player in the game, having a tragic story behind her tough personality. Her role is a North Korean defector who was a young pickpocketer before playing in games.</span></p><p><span>Jung Ho Yeon is an accomplished model who worked under modeling agencies such as The Society Management of New York, Nomad Management of Los Angeles, and Miami. However, its no doubt that the Squid Game was notably the top drama series of 2021, and actors involved in this drama have gotten enough attention and popularity to cover up their struggling days.
