She <a href=#>makes a ton of money from sponsored posts</a> and has impressed everyone with her high net worth, charm, and poise at such a young age. The LSU gymnast seems to genuinely enjoy sharing her life with her huge fanbase.</p><p>Even though Olivia Dunne is a pro when it comes to getting likes and engagement on her Instagram account, she <strong>made a mistake on Instagram that could have affected her income</strong>. In this article, we'll take a look at what happened, along with how she began her influencing career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-olivia-dunne-39-s-instagram-photo-policy-mistake>Inside Olivia Dunne's Instagram Photo Policy Mistake</h2><p>According to The Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Dunne made a mistake on Instagram</a> in March 2024 and <strong>shared a photo on her Instagram Stories that revealed part of her body</strong>. While Dunne removed the picture, people noticed that her nipple seemed to be visible through her shirt. Since the <strong>social media platform has a "no nudity" policy</strong>,<strong> </strong>The Daily Mail noted that it would be possible for the star to be kicked off Instagram. If this happened, she would have lost her main source of income. According to People, <strong>Dunne had a $3.5 million net worth</strong> as of July 2023, and much of that comes from her social media.</p><p>At the time of this writing, Dunne is still active on Instagram and there is no evidence that there were any negative consequences for the photo that she posted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/olivia-dunne-s-endorsement-and-nil-deals-have-blown-up-her-net-worth-deposit.jpg><p>It doesn't seem like Dunne was aware that her shirt was so revealing.

In 2023, Olivia Dunne talked about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high amount she was paid for one Instagram post</a> and explained that she <strong>made more than $500,000. </strong>People reported that she mentioned this in an episode of the podcast Full Send. If she had lost her Instagram account, it would have been a huge deal. Dunne isn't the only celebrity who gets paid a lot for each Instagram post, as <a href=#>Kylie Jenner makes a fortune per post</a>. However, she stands out because she's a college athlete.</p><p>It would have also been terrible if Olivia Dunne had lost her ability to make money on Instagram because she has acknowledged that <strong>gymnasts have trouble earning an income</strong>. In a March 2023 interview with People, she admitted that she might not be able to continue with the sport after graduating from college.</p><p>Dunne said:</p><p>"With gymnastics, you peak when you're about 15 years old. After college, there's nothing really for gymnasts. There's so many professional leagues for men's sports after college, but there's such a small timeframe for women to capitalize."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template-3.jpg><p>While Olivia Dunne didn't mention whether this mistake affected her TikTok account, she did run into a problem on that account in December 2023.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/megan-fox-s-super-bowl-party-pic-sparks-controversy-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Megan Fox's Now-Deleted Instagram Photo Caused Backlash Among Her Ukrainian Fans</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>One photo was all it took for Megan Fox to spark controversy on social media.</span><p>According to Sports Illustrated, Dunne noticed fewer people engaging with her TikTok. She commented on a video that she posted with her boyfriend and said, “Why am I shadow banned." According to Sprout Social, when someone is shadow banned on social media, fewer people comment and like their posts, and it seems that they are being hidden because they haven't followed the platform's rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-olivia-dunne-become-an-instagram-influencer>How Did Olivia Dunne Become An Instagram Influencer?</h2><p>Olivia Dunne's journey to earning a lot of money on Instagram began when she <strong>set up an account at the age of 10</strong>. According to Business Insider, she was interviewed on the Twin Talk podcast and explained more about the early days of her Instagram fame. She said that she saw more engagement when she posted photos hanging out on the beach during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template-4.jpg><p>Olivia Dunne's Social Media Followers (As Of March 27th 2024)</p><ul><li>Instagram: 5.1 million</li><li>X: 123.8k</li><li>TikTok: 7.9 million</li></ul><p>Dunne's explanation of how she became so popular on Instagram also drives home how much money she could have lost thanks to the mistake she made. She said:</p><p>"It started honestly when I was around 10 years old when I downloaded Instagram. I know that sounds really far back, but I've always loved social media stuff. I did Elite Gymnastics growing up, so I accumulated a following for gymnastics first. I'd say I got about 100,000 followers on Instagram through just gymnastics, and I hadn't even started TikTok yet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-olivia-dunne-s-rumored-boyfriend-paul-skenes-slide-into-her-dms_-here-s-how-they-really-met.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Olivia Dunne's Boyfriend Paul Skenes Slide Into Her DMs?

I want more of this in my life!’ I just knew this is something I wanted to do. I was 10 or 11, and there were younger girls looking up to me and people starting to recognize me.
