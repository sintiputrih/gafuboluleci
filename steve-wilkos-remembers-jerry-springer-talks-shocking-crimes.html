There was a murderer who was tracked by his Fitbit. Even if you’re smart, there are so many different ways to trip yourself up!” Here, the married dad of two (he wed TV producer <strong>Rachelle Consiglio</strong> in 2000) talks to In Touch‘s <strong>Katie Bruno</strong> about his late mentor, Jerry (the longtime host <a href=#>died in April at age 79 of pancreatic cancer</a>), dream guests and more.</p><p><strong>What do you think is going on in people’s minds when they kill?</strong><br><strong>SW</strong>: It’s amazing to me. I’ve been in relationships that have ended, I’ve been divorced…you move on. I never thought, “I want out of this relationship so I’m going to poison or kill them.” That’s not the normal thought process. People think they can get away with it.</p><p><strong>What’s the most shocking crime you’ve seen on your show?</strong><br><strong>SW</strong>: The highest-rated show we ever did was a woman who believed her young daughter was poisoning her. The daughter seemed so sweet and innocent, but she failed the lie detector test and admitted she was putting bleach in her mother’s orange juice every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/steve-wilkos-and-jerry-springer.jpg><p><strong>Any dream celeb guests?</strong><br><strong>SW</strong>: <strong>Will Smith</strong> and also <strong>Jussie Smollett</strong>. When I heard about his story, I thought the whole thing stunk. [In 2021, the Empire actor was found guilty of lying to authorities after <a href=#>claiming he was attacked in a hate crime</a>.] He’s sticking to his story — I’d love for him to come on and take a lie detector test.</p><p><strong>You’ve now been in the TV business for 30 years. How does it feel?</strong><br><strong>SW</strong>: When I first started on The Jerry Springer Show, I was a policeman. I had hair! I thought it was just a security job for one day. My role kept increasing, and I hosted when Jerry was on Dancing With the Stars [in 2006]. Then they gave me my own show. I’m very blessed.</p><p><strong>What’s one of your wildest moments from his show?</strong><br><strong>SW</strong>: We had two little guys on — one friend was sleeping with the other friend’s wife — and they started fighting. We ran up on stage, and they started throwing us around. I’m 6-foot-3 and weighed about 245 pounds — it was embarrassing! Backstage, the producers tell us they’re champion wrestlers!</p><p><strong>What did you learn from Jerry?</strong><br><strong>SW</strong>: At one time, Jerry was the biggest star in the world. He was a gentleman with great manners who always showed up on time. I’m sure there are people who worked with me who say, “He’s a d—head,” but nobody’s ever going to say that about Jerry. He was truly the nicest guy in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJoqq2dppp6uLXLpKasZaKauqa5wZ6prGWamr%2BzxYysp6uhnpyys3nTmqOkq12otbCvyqKloGWTp7ausdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mary-bowser.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Slave Who Helped Bring Down The Confederacy">&larr;
