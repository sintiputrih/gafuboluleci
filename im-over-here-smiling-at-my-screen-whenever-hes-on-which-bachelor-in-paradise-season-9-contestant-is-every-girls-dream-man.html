With the perfect combination of brains, brawn, and beauty — as well as a sense of humor that will undoubtedly leave the women of Paradise drooling — keep scrolling to see who the girlies are gushing over on Bachelor In Paradise.</p><h2 id=h-which-bachelor-in-paradise-season-9-contestant-is-every-girl-s-dream-man data-injectable=false>Which Bachelor In Paradise season 9 contestant is every girl’s dream man?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Henry-Spurlock-Bachelor-In-Paradise.png><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>If you are not swooning over the one and only <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Henry Spurlock</a></strong> on Bachelor In Paradise, who hit the beach during episode 4, you may need to head to the optometrist to get your eyes checked.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>For those who are unfamiliar, John Henry made his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor Nation</a>&nbsp;debut on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Lawson</a>’s season of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a>, however, his time on the show was short lived (to say the least). After failing to form a connection with the leading lady in a timely manner, the 31-year-old was eliminated during week two, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving fans of&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;franchise with&nbsp;soooo&nbsp;many questions about this underwater welder</a>.</p><p data-characters=770 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, John Henry’s official biography for&nbsp;The Bachelorette&nbsp;season 20 sums up exactly who he is beyond our television screens: “John Henry is ready for a love deeper than the ocean. While he’s extremely passionate about his work as an underwater welder, John Henry has yet to find the spark of everlasting love. John Henry is looking for a woman who is trustworthy, adventurous, and has a good sense of humor. His dream is to take his future wife diving, so hopefully Charity is ready for some aquatic exploration. When he’s not working, John Henry loves hitting the gym and jamming out to A$AP Rocky. While John Henry says he can be a bit shy at first, once he opens up, he’s all in. We can’t wait to see if he and Charity hit it off!”</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>While John Henry did not find love with Charity (obviously), perhaps he will have some luck with the women of Paradise…</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>While the North Carolina native has yet to steal hearts in Mexico just yet — with the exception of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Olivia Lewis</a>’, whom he took on a romantic spa date during episode 4 — it is safe to say that John Henry has stolen the hearts of fans of Bachelor Nation across the globe.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>“Honestly the guy is my dream man,” @No_Delay3465 gushed via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>. “He has every single thing I look for in a potentially long term partner. I’m surprised everyone on the beach isn’t melting over him. I wouldn’t have eyes for anyone else if that man stepped into the beach. He’s hot, reserved, shy, funny, awkward, seems respectful (graceful and charismatic), and like a very, very good guy to have by your side. I’m over here smiling at my screen whenever he’s on. Idk how those women aren’t completely struck by him.”</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Garnering 152 upvotes and 126 comments, numerous Bachelor In Paradise viewers wholeheartedly agree with @No_Delay3465’s opinion.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>“I know right, I’m here giggling like a school girl every time he is on screen,” one Reddit user shared.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Another wrote, “He’s soooo much different than what I expected him to be, and it’s refreshing. I’m not sure why I was expecting him to be a jerk? I literally don’t know when I made that up in my head, but him proving me wrong so far has been so hot. He’d definitely be one of my top picks on the beach too!”</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>“I have so many things to say about John Henry. For one, he is not my typical type (good ol’ country boy, all-American looking), but Jesus Christ he’s hot. I’m in love. Two, his sleeve is ACTUALLY good. I mean, the amount of poor tattoo work in this show is embarrassing, but he’s got good taste. Three, it doesn’t look like he follows any of the Trump family on Instagram, so I’m hopeful,” dished a third.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Word on the street is that John Henry gets engaged at the end of Bachelor In Paradise</a>, but who is the lucky lady? Spoiler alert — it is not Olivia Lewis, despite their seemingly perfect one-on-one date.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=false>To see who steals the heart of John Henry Spurlock in the end, tune into new episodes of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;at 9pm ET/8pm CT on ABC</a>, with new episodes available to stream on Hulu the next day. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">With Hurricane Kat brewing up a storm</a>, things are about to get wild…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yquYyorZ6qXZ2ys7GMrKSipJmjtG6t02aksmWjmL%2Bmsc1mrqGdnprDpr6MoZysZZ%2Bjeri0yJyfZpqRmLWmuM6rZKKmXaWus63DoqqeZaOarrS7zWZwZpufo8Gmv9Oapa1lmah6psLEq7Bmn5mnubR5w6ucmqVdoq6vew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./randall-carlson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-525925-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Randall Carlson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
