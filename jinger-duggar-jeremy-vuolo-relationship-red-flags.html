For years, the #FreeJinger movement hoped for "freedom" for Jinger, meaning they wanted her to leave the Duggar family compound without a husband.</p><p>Once Jinger did move away from her family home, the Free Jinger movement focused on other Duggar siblings (including Jana, the oldest non-married Duggar child as of 2024), but fans have still kept a close eye on Jinger. While Jinger has broken away from her family and their apparently stifling religious beliefs, fans are not convinced that she is truly "free."</p><p>Here is what we know about Jinger Duggar and Jeremy Vuolo's relationship timeline, including some key points where fans thought they saw red flags. From the couple's courtship to their wedding, growing their family, and their big move to California, here's what to know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jinger-vuolo-was-married-by-the-age-of-22>Jinger Vuolo Was Married By The Age Of 22</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jinger-duggar-jeremy-vuolo-counting-on.jpg><p>Jinger is the Duggar family's sixth child (though the fifth living child), and like her siblings, she got married relatively young.</p><h3 id=jinger-and-jeremy-met-in-may-2015>Jinger and Jeremy met in May 2015</h3><p>Jinger, who was born in 1993, reporetdly met Jeremy Vuolo through her sister Jessa's husband, Ben Seewald.
