From the happy times to the sad, the family have, in many ways, opened their doors to the public to get a peak at their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that cannot be faulted about the <a href=#>Kar-Jenners is that they have created many successful businesses</a> over the years and could be said to have their own million (and in some cases, billion) dollar industry. It turns out that all of this success can be put down to their TV show, which quickly became a clever marketing plan.</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-earned-their-wealth-through-fame>The Kardashians Earned Their Wealth Through Fame</h2><p>With a number of successful reality TV shows and businesses under their belts, this has managed to bring in a huge amount of wealth for the family, despite them already being from a relatively privileged position prior to their TV show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-kardashians.jpg><p>The Kar-Jenners are known to be quite competitive, but whether this actually comes down to <a href=#>their respective net worths</a> or not is unknown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> is reported to be the richest of the family and was once said to be worth $1 billion, as well as being the youngest 'self-made' billionaire.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Inside Of Kim Kardashian's House Is Filled With Outrageous and Utterly 'Cold' Luxuries That Prove She's Not Afraid To Spend Her Net Worth</a></span></p><p>However, this <a href=#>claim was soon disputed</a>, although she is said to be actually worth $700 million, which is still a very impressive amount to be worth at such a young age; especially as she is the youngest of the family.</p><p>Each of the Kardashian-Jenners is worth at least $30 million, all thanks to their fame through KUWTK.</p><h2 id=why-did-the-kardashians-start-their-tv-show>Why Did The Kardashians Start Their TV Show?</h2><p>Like all good TV shows, all of them have to begin somewhere and will more than likely have been created due to one specific purpose.</p><p>Many may be of the opinion that the Kardashians started their show with the purpose of showcasing what their family is like, however, there were some other reasons behind the show starting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-kardashians-1.jpg><p>Whilst there may have been a part of them that decided to start the show to show the lives of their family, this isn't entirely the truth behind them first coming up with the idea for the show.</p><p>Even though it is more than likely that this will have been what was pitched to commissioners, there was a whole other reason underneath it all that led to the creation of, arguably, one of the most popular TV shows out there.</p><p>When the show had been going for a few years, the mastermind behind it all, Kris Jenner, appeared on Beyond Candid With Giuliana, and it was on there that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she really spilled the tea</a>, including the whole reasoning behind the family wanting to have their own show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Wound Up Leading KUWTK, But She Wasn't Meant To Be Its Star</a></span></p><p>Those who have watched KUWTK from the start may or may not remember that two of the family's businesses, DASH and Smooch, featured quite prominently in the series early on. Both of these businesses launched prior to the show being aired and due to them being in their early years at this stage, the Kardashians decided to make the most of the TV show and turned it into a business opportunity.</p><p>Kris revealed on Beyond Candid With Giuliana that the reason why they decided to do the show was that they realized that they would be able to attract more customers to their stores by getting a TV show involved. Whether they realized quite how successful the show would be is unknown, but it at least got them some success.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After Her Latest Move, Is Kim Kardashian Just Manufacturing Fame?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Smooch was first shut down in 2009 and even though they managed to open a few more DASH stores over the years, that company also got shut down a few years later in 2018.</p><p>While their tactic may not have completely worked for these businesses, the show has given them a much bigger platform and more success than they would have gotten without it.</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-expanded-kuwtk-into-more-business-opportunities>The Kardashians Expanded KUWTK Into More Business Opportunities</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-on-kuwtk.jpg><p>Since the days of DASH and Smooch, the Kardashians have long moved on and now all individually own some very successful businesses and their momager, Kris, gets to take home an impressive <a href=#>10% of all of their business ventures</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>'s lifestyle brand Pooch, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>'s Good American clothing brand, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>'s SKIMS shapewear brand, and Kylie's makeup brand Kylie Cosmetics, just to name a few. There was even a recent documentary about how the family has been able to make its money over the years by building up their businesses.</p><p>Given that they own numerous successful businesses, it could easily be mistaken that the Kardashians would have some useful business advice to give to those who want to start their own business. But it turns out that the advice wasn't as well received as they may have hoped.</p><p><a href=#>Kim saw her best business 'advice'</a> as being to tell people to essentially get up and work. Many felt this was the wrong advice to give because it was ignoring that success, particularly in business, isn't always just down to hard work and can also be down to factors such as one's upbringing and being in the right place at the right time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the Kardashians' success, that little bit of luck might be what tipped the scales.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4ytn55loKS2r8CMqJ1mo5Wavaq6xmasqWWnnsGpedOhnGajkaexor%2FHopinq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./corinne-brinkerhoff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Corinne Brinkerhoff">&larr;
