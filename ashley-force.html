As a Top Alcohol Dragster rookie in 2004, she won three of the season’s final five races, including the 50th annual Mac Tools U.S Nationals in Indianapolis and the season-ending Automobile Club of Southern California event in Pomona. In 2007, she joined her father’s company, John Force Racing, and drove a Mustang Top Fuel Funny Car sponsored by Castrol for her father’s team.</p><p>But the father-daughter team also made NHRA history by racing against each other.
