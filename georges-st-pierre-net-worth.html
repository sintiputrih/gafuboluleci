He is widely regarded as one of the best fighters in mixed martial arts history and has won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career.</p><p>Georges retired in 2013 as the reigning welterweight champion after winning the most title bouts in UFC history. However, he returned to the octagon in 2017 and became the fourth-ever multi-division champion in UFC history by defeating Michael Bisping and claiming the Middleweight title. Georges retired again in 2020.</p><p>Georges has been named Canadian Athlete of the Year and was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2020. Many consider him to be the best welterweight fighter of all time, and his accomplishments in the sport are unparalleled.</p><h2><span id=Georges_St-Pierres_Early_Life_and_Martial_Arts_Journey>Georges St-Pierre’s Early Life and Martial Arts Journey</span></h2><p>Georges St-Pierre was born in Saint-Isidore, Quebec, in 1981. He was bullied in school and turned to martial arts as a means of self-defense. By the age of 12, he had earned a second dan black belt in Kyokushin Karate. He later learned wrestling, boxing, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. To pay for his tuition fees, he worked as a garbage collector and a bouncer. At 20, he became a professional fighter.</p><h2><span id=Georges_St-Pierres_UFC_Career>Georges St-Pierre’s UFC Career</span></h2><p>Georges St-Pierre began his UFC career with a win against Karo Parisyan at UFC 46, and followed up with a TKO win against Jay Hieron at UFC 48. However, he suffered his first defeat at the hands of Matt Hughes, tapping out from an armbar in the first round. St-Pierre bounced back with convincing victories against several fighters.</p><p>After defeating B.J. Penn, St-Pierre begged the UFC for a title shot, but a groin injury took him out of the fight. During his recovery, he appeared on “The Ultimate Fighter” as a trainer. St-Pierre later won the Welterweight Championship against Matt Hughes, but suffered his second-ever career loss against Matt Serra.</p><p>St-Pierre went on to defend his welterweight title against several fighters, including Jon Fitch, Thiago Alves, and Dan Hardy. He temporarily retired from the UFC in 2013, but returned in 2017 to fight Michael Bisping for the middleweight title. After a few potential fights fell through, St-Pierre officially retired from the UFC in 2020.</p><h2><span id=Georges_St-Pierres_UFC_Earnings_Per-Fight_Payment_and_Pay-Per-View_Bonuses>Georges St-Pierre’s UFC Earnings: Per-Fight Payment and Pay-Per-View Bonuses</span></h2><p>Georges St-Pierre earned millions of dollars per year during his time fighting in the UFC. He earned a guaranteed payment of $200,000 per fight, with an additional $200,000 bonus if he won the fight, bringing his potential base pay to $400,000 per fight.</p><p>However, the real money for UFC fighters comes from Pay-Per-View sales. St-Pierre was entitled to a significant stake in his fight’s PPV earnings, with the exact percentage never fully revealed. Based on Randy Couture’s contract, it’s estimated that St-Pierre was earning just as much, if not more.</p><p>Couture’s contract stipulated that he would receive a bonus of $1 per buy for PPV sales up to 175,000 buys, $1.5 per buy for sales above 175,000 up to 300,000, $2 per buy for sales above 300,000, and $3 per buy for sales above 330,000. For example, St-Pierre’s fight at UFC 158 generated 950,000 PPV buys, which would have earned him at least $2.85 million in bonuses according to Couture’s contract. However, UFC president Dana White suggested that St-Pierre’s earnings that night were closer to $5 million, indicating that he likely earned between $3.25 and $5.4 million from UFC 158 alone.</p><h2><span id=Georges_St-Pierres_Brand_Endorsements>Georges St-Pierre’s Brand Endorsements</span></h2><p>Georges St-Pierre partnered with various brands including Under Armour, NOS energy drink (owned by Coca-Cola), Hayaboosa, 888poker, Affliction, Electronic Arts, and Bacardi. His endorsements combined would have resulted in additional earnings of $1 to $2 million per fight.</p><h2><span id=GSPs_Total_Earnings>GSP’s Total Earnings</span></h2><p>With all sources of income taken into account, GSP was earning $12 to $15 million per year at the height of his UFC career.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCzxKipoJ2jYsC1ec%2BinKuqlWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lonette-mckee-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lonette McKee Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;
