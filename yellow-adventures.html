She hates it when Pokémon are injured, hers or her opponent's, and has developed a style of battle in which neither her nor her opponent's Pokémon are hurt unless it is absolutely necessary. Despite her childlike nature, she can be very serious when people and places she cares about are threatened, as shown in <i><a href=# title=PS290>A Well-Journeyed Jumpluff</a></i>, when she became enraged after Team Rocket's <a href=# title=Sird>Sird</a> and <a href=# title=Orm>Orm</a> staged a battle between <a href=# title="Silver (Adventures)">Silver</a> and her in Viridian Forest that resulted in the forest being damaged.</p><p>Yellow's special skill, as described by <a href=# title="Professor Oak (Adventures)">Professor Oak</a>, is Pokémon healing and she is called the <b>"Healer</b>" (<span class=explain title=いやすもの>癒やす者</span> <i>Healer</i>). She received psychic abilities from <a href=# title="Viridian Forest">Viridian Forest</a>, which include the ability to read the emotions of Pokémon and heal their wounds.

She takes Red's <a href=# title="Pikachu (Pokémon)">Pikachu</a>, <a href=# title=Pika>Pika</a>, and promises to find Red. Oak doesn't trust her and he makes her battle his <a href=# title="Spearow (Pokémon)">Spearow</a> with her Doduo. She defeats him and doesn't even injure either Pokémon, allowing her to gain Oak's trust. She is then fishing in <a href=# title="Viridian Forest">Viridian Forest</a> when Pika wanders off and sees <a href=# title="Bill (Adventures)">Bill</a> drowning. Pika runs back to Yellow and she reads his mind and rescues Bill from a <a href=# title="Seadra (Pokémon)">Seadra</a> which she catches and releases after healing it.</p><p>Bill then stays with her for a while, and the two of them run into <a href=# title=Lorelei>Lorelei</a> of the Elite Four, who explains everything to them, which Yellow seemed to already know. They escaped from her and her <a href=# title="Dewgong (Pokémon)">Dewgong</a>, but she later found them in a cave and attacked them with her <a href=# title="Cloyster (Pokémon)">Cloyster</a>. She was attempting to bury them alive in that cave by combining Dewgong's and Cloyster's attacks to form an Ice Spike Cannon. Yellow then had Pika act as a decoy for a bit by throwing his Poké Ball out through a small crack and then got him back in. She read his mind and got out of the cave by using the same tactic except with a fake Poké Ball as a decoy. They are chased by Lorelei and when they jump into a lake she freezes it over, and starts to ask questions about Yellow's ability. While she was asking these questions, <a href=# title=Ratty>Ratty</a> was biting through the iceberg and they were freed and before Lorelei could once again call out her Pokémon to stop them, <a href=# title="Green (Adventures)">Green</a> appeared and knocked her Poké Ball away. Lorelei then contacted <a href=# title=Agatha>Agatha</a> and told her about Yellow's ability, proclaiming her to become a potential threat and that she is now a target of the Elite Four as well.</p><p>She then is found by <a href=# title=Erika>Erika</a>, who hears about her from <a href=# title=Misty>Misty</a> and wants to put <a href=# title=Pika>Pika</a> under her care. After hearing about a Red look-a-like Pika rushes off. The look-a-like turns out to be a <a href=# title="Super Nerd (Trainer class)">Super Nerd</a> who was hired by <a href=# title=Agatha>Agatha</a> to kidnap Pika. After chasing him for a while the super nerd uses his <a href=# title="Persian (Pokémon)">Persian</a> to <a href=# title="Scratch (move)">Scratch</a> on the walls to hurt Yellows ears and make her lose her focus, he then uses his <a href=# title="Marowak (Pokémon)">Marowak</a>'s <a href=# title="Bonemerang (move)">Bonemerang</a> laced with spores from his <a href=# title="Paras (Pokémon)">Paras</a> in order to incapacitate her Pokémon. She later recalled her Pokémon and healed them, taking a Bonemerang to the ribs because of it. She then had her Pokémon execute a plan that she thought of before she was knocked out. She had Dody and Ratty dig up pieces of metal and had Pika zap them, and since the Super Nerd was in an electric proof suit, they hit him. Before the good Gym Leaders of Kanto can fully examine him a Gastly appears and tries to whisk him away. When Blaine tries to have his Growlithe use <a href=# title="Fire Blast (move)">Fire Blast</a> to take it out it almost hits a Caterpie which Yellow manages to save. <a href=# title="Blue (Adventures)">Blue</a> appears and defeats Gastly, telling the Gym Leaders that it belonged to <a href=# title=Agatha>Agatha</a> of the Elite Four. Yellow then asks to train with him, which he allows, but before she leaves, Misty gives her Omny and <a href=# title=Brock>Brock</a> gives her Gravvy.</p><p>When training with Blue, she then finds out that the Caterpie she had saved followed her all the way to their training area. After Blue tells her to catch that Caterpie, it becomes clear that Yellow doesn't actually know the basics of Pokémon. She didn't know what Ratty's attacks were, she didn't know what Evolution was and cried when Ratty evolved, and all of the Pokémon she owned she obtained other than through battle. She then decided to have her new Caterpie which she named <a href=# title=Kitty>Kitty</a> get to know Pika while she got Vermilion Flowers, which are supposed to be a Caterpie's favorite food, only to find that the two of them were asleep after Pika saved it from death multiple times (from a cliff, several cacti, and three <a href=# title="Pidgeotto (Pokémon)">Pidgeotto</a>). After training Dody and Ratty for about a week she then attempts to train the Pokémon she gained from the Gym Leaders but without their respective leaders they were confused and refused to listen to Yellow. A pack of Mankey then appeared because they were hungry and planned on eating Yellow and Blue, but Blue instructed Yellow to defeat the Primeape leader while he took out the front lines. When it became clear that she couldn't he used his Porygon to defeat it and the pack ran away. Yellow then healed the Primeape and told Blue that she would continue to train on her own.</p><p>Since she didn't have a Pokémon that could Surf, Blue told her to take the <a href=# title="S.S. Anne">S.S. Anne</a> where she ran into the <a href=# title="Team Rocket Elite Trio">Team Rocket Elite Trio</a>. They exploded the S.S. Anne using a Slowpoke and Yellow takes them on wanting to see how much Blue's training has payed off. When all of the passengers fall off the boat as a result of the bomb she has Caterpie use String Shot to make buoys to ensure the passenger's safety. She then defeats the Rockets quite easily with the small help of the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman. The Chairman then learns of Red's kidnapping.</p><p>She then learns of the legendary Evolution stones that evolve Pokémon but do not disappear after use. She tries to get it only to be swarmed by a group of Tentacool. She then finds out the reason was that a baby Tentacool was stuck under a rock and she and Gravvy move it, almost dying but the baby Tentacool allowed her to breathe underwater out of gratitude. She then finds out that the only stone still there was the Leaf Stone and that Red must have taken them to evolve <a href=# title=Vee>Vee</a> (Blue previously made her memorize all of Red's entries so that was how she learned of Eevee).</p><p>It is later revealed that it was in fact <a href=# title="Green (Adventures)">Green</a> who sent Yellow on this quest and disguised her as a boy, also bugging her hat so she could track her location and hear her talking.</p><p>When Yellow is trying to find a Pokémon that can Surf she hears of a Vermilion Surfing Contest with the prize being a <a href=# title="Dragonair (Pokémon)">Dragonair</a> that could Surf for her. She borrows a Slowpoke from a swimmer but before the event starts, the Dragonair is revealed to belong to Lance and with one blast, he destroys Vermilion City, although since Vermilion Surfing Contest is such a big event he knew there would be few fatalities. After finding out that Yellow's Pikachu was Pika he attempts to take it simply to calm Agatha and Lorelei who were angry that it eluded both of them. After being tossed around Pikachu learned Surf by manipulating its <a href=# title="Substitute (move)">Substitute</a> and then Lance disappeared.</p><p>After sleeping in a forest of Exeggutor and Oddish she found that they were abnormally migrating from Professor Oak due to the attacks of the Elite Four destroying habitats and throwing the balance of nature out of balance. When she came back to Cinnabar Island she saw a man training his Arcanine and an unknown Pokémon (later revealed to be <a href=# title="Mewtwo (Pokémon)">Mewtwo</a>). The man then takes Yellow back to his Gym and reveals himself to be Blaine wearing a disguise. The two of them then learn that Brock had found something on <a href=# title="Mt. Moon">Mt. Moon</a>, an ice sculpture of Red frozen in ice. After learning from Blaine that the Elite Four HQ was on <a href=# title="Cerise Island">Cerise Island</a> and that the respective cities of the good Gym Leaders of Kanto were under attack the two of them decided to attack Cerise Island but travel there via different routes. Once she reaches Cerise Island she meets up with Blue and they stealthily navigate the island by having Jigglypuff fly them across shrouded in Horsea's Smokescreen. Once the map Yellow obtained was eaten by a Slowbro they followed it to a cave and found Blaine, Blue, Koga, Sabrina, and Lt. Surge.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/31/Yellow_battling_Lance.png/375px-Yellow_battling_Lance.png decoding=async width=250 height=254 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Yellow battling Lance <a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/dc/YellowBlaineSpoons.png/300px-YellowBlaineSpoons.png decoding=async width=200 height=153 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>In the final battle on <a href=# title="Cerise Island">Cerise Island</a>, <a href=# title=Sabrina>Sabrina</a>'s <a href=# title="Spoons of Destiny">Spoons of Destiny</a> choose <a href=# title=Blaine>Blaine</a> as Yellow's partner. The two of them intrude on Bruno's battle with Lt. Surge and Bill, but they are blocked out by a barrier. When Electrode's Explosion goes off it sends up a tsunami that drenches Blaine and Yellow, washing off her hat and revealing her ponytail, revealing to all that she was actually a girl. The two of them find themselves facing <a href=# title=Lance>Lance</a> in a fierce and long battle. In the beginning Blaine had Yellow stay back and he battle Lance with Mewtwo single-handedly and almost defeated him until their emotional connection made them pass out. Although Blaine was aware that this may happen he decided to let Yellow finish off Lance's weakened Pokémon while Blaine went for Lance's Poké Balls so he couldn't call upon any other Pokémon. Although the Poké Balls were destroyed Lance revealed that he had already sent his Pokémon out of their Poké Balls before the battle even started. Lance then revealed that he was also a blessed Viridian Trainer like Yellow and had the same powers that she had. After dragging the battle to the top of Cerise Island which was a volcanic crater Lance was able to gain an advantage with bubbles that were invisible to light by coloring them red, blue, and green. Giovanni then comes to Yellow's assistance but that forces the final Badge that Lance needed to power his Badge Energy Amplifier, which he had enlarged to become Cerise Island. He used the Amplifier to summon <a href=# title="Tower duo (Adventures)">Lugia</a>, controlling it so it would help him wipe out humanity. Without a Pokédex to stop her team from evolving, she let her team completely evolve (including Kitty who evolved twice in a row, and Gravvy, who most often doesn't evolve except by trade). With all of her team's newfound power Yellow was able to channel all of their energy and have Pika use an attack known as Megavolt, an attack 10 times more powerful than a regular thunderbolt, defeating Lance and scaring Lugia away.</p><p>After it all ends, she returns <a href=# title=Pika>Pika</a> to <a href=# title="Red (Adventures)">Red</a>, who is left the only main character unaware of Yellow's real gender.</p><h3><span id=Gold.2C_Silver_.26_Crystal_arc></span><span class=mw-headline id=Gold,_Silver_&_Crystal_arc><a href=# title="Gold, Silver & Crystal arc (Adventures)"><i>Gold, Silver & Crystal</i> arc</a></span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/4f/YellowGSC.png/150px-YellowGSC.png decoding=async width=100 height=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Yellow in the <i>Gold, Silver & Crystal</i> arc<p>Yellow has become a normal citizen of <a href=# title="Viridian City">Viridian City</a> once more until her Uncle <a href=# title=Wilton>Wilton</a> calls for her and suggests that she head to <a href=# title=Johto>Johto</a> to search for information about the mysterious being that appeared atop <a href=# title="Cerise Island">Cerise Island</a> the year before.

One day, she went to the Gym in <a href=# title="Viridian City">Viridian City</a>, where she hoped that she would see <a href=# title="Blue (Adventures)">Blue</a>. He was, however, not there but had a hologram of himself instead. It asked her for a battle, which <a href=# title=Chuchu>Chuchu</a> wanted to do but the two lost horribly to Blue's well trained Pokémon.</p><p>After leaving the Gym, Yellow bumped into <a href=# title="Silver (Adventures)">Silver</a>, who she remembered from the battle against the <a href=# title="Masked Man">Masked Man</a> two years before. He revealed to her that he came to Viridian in order to try to find his parents, who he hadn't seen since he was a child. Yellow offered to help by seeing into <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Silver's Sneasel">Sneasel</a>'s memories but was turned down because Silver had tried before with <a href=# title=Lance>Lance</a>'s powers. However, she did read Sneasel's mind and detected a faint, recently unlocked memory of the statue that resided inside the Gym. The two Pokédex holders raced in and looked at it.</p><p>Silver then demanded Yellow to tell her who the statue was of and she explained that the statue was of <a href=# title="Giovanni (Adventures)">Giovanni</a>, the previous Gym leader of Viridian City and the true leader of <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a>. They left the Gym and Silver told her that he was going to find Giovanni and find out how they were related, which Yellow pleaded him not to do, reminding him that he was dangerous.</p><p>An <a href=# title="Team Rocket airship">airship</a> appeared over them that had the symbol of Team Rocket on it. An aircar was then released from it. After Silver used his <a href=# title="Silver's Gyarados">Gyarados</a> against it, two people came out, stating that they were there to take Silver away. The two introduced themselves as <a href=# title=Sird>Sird</a> and <a href=# title=Orm>Orm</a>, then challenged Yellow and Silver to a Tag Battle, which Silver accepted for the two.</p><p>Yellow was attacked by Orm's <a href=# title="Jumpluff (Pokémon)">Jumpluff</a> and appeared to be near defeat as the grass types spores float around the battlefield until she used her powers to move Poké Balls to send her <a href=# title=Omny>Omny</a> outside the range of the spores and had it attack Sird, Orm, and Jumpluff, who was frozen by Omny's <a href=# title="Blizzard (move)">Blizzard</a>.</p><p>After Orm used his Black Pokédex, which was made by the third Elite Rocket <a href=# title=Carr>Carr</a>, to scan the <a href=# title=Level>levels</a> of Yellow's <a href=# title=Party>party</a> and called Yellow's Pokémon weak, Yellow lashed out, telling them to leave <a href=# title="Viridian Forest">Viridian Forest</a> as it had been the stage of far too many battles already. It was then that all of Yellow's Pokémon's levels skyrocketed into the 80's.</p><p>After this level increase, the four battlers on the ground noticed that the Team Rocket airship had turned into the Stadium Mode. While they were watching the events above them unfold, Sird told Silver that his father was Giovanni, which shocked the two Pokédex holders. Sird took advantage of Silver's state of disbelief by putting the boy to sleep and taking him up to the airship with her and Orm, leaving Yellow to follow them.</p><p>While flying with the use of <a href=# title=Kitty>Kitty</a>, Yellow used <a href=# title=Ratty>Ratty</a> to make a hole on the side of the airship so that they could get in. She then infiltrated the place, her mind set on finding Silver. However, she gets lost and finds her way out on to the mid air battle stadium that <a href=# title="Red (Adventures)">Red</a> and <a href=# title="Mewtwo (Adventures)">Mewtwo</a> are fighting against Giovanni and Deoxys on. Surprised to see Red, she nervously calls out to him, who is equally as shocked to see her as she is to see him. He then asks her why she is there. She starts to explain but soon turns to Deoxys, wondering if the DNA Pokémon is the one who just spoke to her in her mind.</p><p>Yellow then realizes that Deoxys is trying to tell her something and it hasn't got much time left. After learning the Pokémon's name, she concentrates on it and is shocked by what she hears. She then turns and tells Red that Deoxys told her that it is him.</p><p>After learning of Deoxys's past from Sird, Yellow is shocked and demands to know where the first Deoxys, Organism No. 1, is. Sird tells her that it had been abandoned and Yellow feels sorry for the weak Deoxys that is in her arms. She then realizes that Sird had yet to tell them why Organism No. 2 thinks he's Red.</p><p>Sird tells Yellow to concentrate on Deoxys's background story as she reads its mind. However, as Sird explains, now that they have Giovanni's son Deoxys is useless.</p><p>Suddenly, the airship starts shaking and they all realize that the ship is about to explode. As the stadium closes in, Yellow, Red, Mewtwo, and Deoxys make it into the airship and Red tells them that they need to stop the ship from exploding. He then takes Deoxys, but Yellow isn't sure if it's a good idea to take the weakened Pokémon but Red reassures her. Yellow then starts to doze off and Red realizes that she has used too much energy by reading Deoxys's mind.</p><p>Red then sends Giovanni, Silver, Yellow, and Mewtwo to the ground thanks to the black hole that Deoxys was able to make. Yellow, worried about Red, protests but he walks away. However, Yellow grabs a hold of Red's finger with her fishing rod and tells him not to go because she has to continue to explain about Organism No. 2. Meanwhile, Chuchu spots her partner <a href=# title=Pika>Pika</a> and leaves its Poké Ball. Yellow doesn't notice and continues, explaining that Giovanni had collected Red's blood five years previously and had used it to create Deoxys, making the DNA Pokémon consider Red its relative. Now finished telling Red everything, she falls through the black hole, leaving her hat at the spot where she just stood.</p><p>She comes out of the black hole, unconscious due to the energy loss that she had suffered.
