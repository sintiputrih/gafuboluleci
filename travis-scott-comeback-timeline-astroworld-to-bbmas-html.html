(Eight died on November 5 with two dying days later due to their injuries.) Scott responded with multiple statements in the days after the festival, attempting to absolve himself of guilt. He currently <a href=#>faces a slew of multimillion-dollar lawsuits</a> over the event and has been the subject of much scrutiny. But the rapper has also been slowly making his comeback, even performing at small events and releasing new music. This year, he was due to headline the Day N Vegas festival, one of his first shows to be canceled after the tragedy.<strong> </strong>The 2022 festival has now been <a href=#>canceled</a> due to “logistics, timing and production issues.” But those who have been closely watching Scott’s post-Astroworld moves know that Day N Vegas was just one part of a slow, monthslong return to the public eye — one that, like <a href=#>the growing lawsuits</a>, likely won’t stop given that <a href=#>Scott was readying a project</a> before Astroworld.
