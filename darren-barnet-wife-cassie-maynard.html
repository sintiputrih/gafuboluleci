For his followers, the queries “Is he married” and “Is there a Darren Barnet wife” are of significant interest. He is not married, thus the answer to the question is no.</strong></p><p>Barnet made his acting debut in 2017 with guest spots on television programs including This Is Us, S.W.A.T., and Criminal Minds, where he played episodic parts.</p><p>The beautiful actor played Hot Seth in the restricted streaming television series Turnt in 2018, which was created by Brat and shown on Facebook Watch.</p><p>The actor also made his film debut in the same year as a supporting player in the Lifetime original film InInstallerBarnet’s acting talents were on display in 2019 when he landed an episode-sized part in the Netflix series Family Reunion.</p><p>Barnet then started playing a significant part in the Netflix adolescent comedy-drama streaming series Never Have I Ever in April 2020.</p><p>He played Paxton Hall-Yoshida, the show’s lead actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s crush on Devi Vishwakumar.</p><p>It’s important to note that media sources emphasized the apparent age gap of about 11 years between Barnet and Ramakrishnan, who was 29 at the start of the show.</p><p>Additionally, he performed in The Summit of Gods and Love Hard. The last season of the program, which premieres today, is likely to entice Devi and his admirers.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Darren Barnet Wife</span></h2><p>Fans were enthralled by the chemistry between Maitreyi and Darren on-screen, which led others to theorize about a possible love relationship in real life.</p><p>It’s crucial to stress that they are only close friends and co-stars and have no romantic ties.</p><p>Although viewers of their popular series Neve Have I Ever are cheering for Devi-Paxton’s love. They also want to know whether Darren Barnet is married and who his wife is.</p><p>Fans are interested in learning more about Darren Barnet’s wife, but as of May 2023, the actor remains single and doesn’t have any.</p><p>He has had a few love relationships in the past, but he hasn’t made up his mind to get married just yet.</p><p>The actor’s viewers are interested to learn if he is wed to Cassie Maynard or not. The answer is no, of course.</p><p>However, for almost two years before its ascent to popularity as Netflix’s sex icon, Barnet was committed to producer Cassie Maynard.</p><p>The couple made their first appearance on Instagram in November 2014 when the “Never Have I Ever” actor uploaded a photo of them skating together.</p><p>Then, to commemorate the couple’s first anniversary, Barnet posted a montage of joyful images to Instagram, showing them grinning in front of Christmas trees.</p><p>The couple’s final shared photo was posted on January 10th, thus it appears that they split up sometime after January 2017. Therefore, Barnet and Cassie Maynard are not wed.</p><p>Barnet, who is 32 years old, is not in a rush to find a partner. His major focus right now is on developing his budding acting career.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Darren Barnet Relationship Timeline</span></h2><p>Darren, who was born in Los Angeles on April 27, 1991, is of mixed ancestry.</p><p>His father has German and Cherokee ancestry, while his mother is of Swedish and Japanese descent.</p><p>Notably, Charlie Barnet, a well-known swing musician, is Barnet’s grandpa. He also has a younger sister as well as an older sister.</p><p>The actor has had a few love connections with famous females since breaking into the glamorous world.</p><p>After splitting from his ex-girlfriend Cassie Maynard, he seemed to date Southpaw actress and model Ali Rose a year later. But after dating for almost a year, the two of them also broke up.</p><p>The actor briefly dated his co-star after the debut of “Love Hard.”</p><p>The pair had made an appearance on the Suicide Squad red carpet while flaunting their P.D.A.</p><p>Although it’s unclear when exactly Barnet and “Love Hard” co-star Mikaela Hoover started dating, they made their romance a public matter in April 2021 on Instagram.</p><p>In addition, Hoover posted a polPolaroidoto of them together to commemorate Barnet’s birthday, suggesting that their connection had probably started earlier.</p><p>“You make me happy,” the actress said in the post, expressing her joy. Angel, happy birthday.</p><p>The Never Have I Ever actor may or may not be in a private relationship, but based on his social media activity, it appears that he is mostly concerned with his acting carcareerd hanging out with pals.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Pam Tork, Brenda Vaccaro, and Axton Joseph."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":19}{"1":21,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":35}{"1":41,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":53}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/pam-tork/"}{"1":19}{"1":21,"2":"https://popularbio.com/brenda-vaccaro/"}{"1":35}{"1":41,"2":"https://popularbio.com/axton-joseph/"}{"1":53}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Pam Tork</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Brenda Vaccaro</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Axton Joseph</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Seth Weathers | Ultra Right CEO Age And Wiki Explore</a></h3>Seth Weathers is rapidly rising in fame as a result of the success of his Ultra Right beer brand.
