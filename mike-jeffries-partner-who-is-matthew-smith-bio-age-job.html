Their story has been documented in Netflix’s new show White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Ambercombio & Fitch. So, it is natural to know more about Matthew.</p><p>As already stated Matthew Smith dated Abercrombie & Fitch‘s CEO Mike Jeffries after the end of his marriage. They dated each other for over two decades. Matt reportedly had a lot of influence even though he was not an employee.</p><p>According to Buzzfeed, Mike had brought him to manage his affairs just before he left.</p><p>Employees shared with Buzzfeed about Matthew and described him as, “A handsome, polished Brit who behaves graciously around his partner’s colleagues, often finishing emails with the sign-off “with every kind wish”… He’s slightly more approachable than Jeffries and more even-tempered.”</p><p>Sources revealed that he&nbsp;regularly attended internal company meetings, and was involved in matters such as Abercrombie & Fitch’s growth plan, and real estate expansion – where Matthew allegedly played a role in choosing international store locations. He used to go solo to monthly real estate meetings at the company’s New Albany, Ohio, headquarters. He sat by the chief financial officer and got weekly real estate briefings from Abercrombie executives, sources revealed to BuzzFeed.</p><h3><strong>Meet Matthew Smith, Mike Jeffries Partner</strong></h3><p>Mattew was described as “dangerous” by two former executives, who cited the fact that he is organizationally unaccountable if something goes wrong with a decision he made.</p><p>Per ex-executive Matthew canceled a lease in Europe that Abercrombie & Fitch executives had already signed. It was unclear whether he took the role as an executive or was fulfilling Mike’s wish. Nevertheless, it created an uncomfortable working dynamic in the company.</p><p>Matthew would complain to his partner Mike about several other “issues” he minds about like the “inappropriate font” in presentation and workstation standards.</p><p>Matthew’s signature on the document revealed that he gets his own copy of non-public Abercrombie & Fitch statistics, such as shop sales figures and daily revenue statements. In the manual, there were also instructions on how to ‘serve’ Matthew aboard the company jet. After 2 p.m., Darjeeling tea must be “served on a small tray with a small tray liner,” according to his tea service notes.</p><p>A private family office that oversees Jeffries’ homes, investments, and compensation, into something more substantial. According to insiders, David Leino, A&F’s senior vice president of real estate, has joked with coworkers that he works for Smith and has spoken freely about having to rush off to his “Matthew meetings.”</p><p>A former pilot of the company jet filed the lawsuit in October, claiming he was dismissed for being ‘too old.’ He charged that Matthew helped screen new employees for the jet, and acted on behalf of Abercrombie & Fitch.</p><h3><strong>Are Mike Jeffries And His Partner Matthew Smith Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Reports suggest that yes, Mike Jeffires and his partner Matthew Smith are still together. The couple now lives in they live with their three dogs in Ohio.</p><p>Before meeting Matthew and living his life as an openly gay person, Mike was married to his ex-wife <a href=#>Susan Marie Isabel Hansen</a>. They tied the knots on 3 April 1971 in Miami, Florida in the garden at the home of his ex-wife’s parents here on Biscayne Bay.</p><p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Susan was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Henry Hansen. Her father was the founder and president of Charles Hansen Music Publishing, producers of sheet music as well as publishers of educational and popular books on music and related fields.</p><p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Susan worked as the director of public relations for the company in New York. At the time, Mike was the executive recruitment director of Abraham & Straus in Brooklyn. Moreover, Susan attended Carrollton Convent of the Sacred Heart in Coconut Grove, Fla., Marymount College in Tarrytown, N. Y., and Finch College. She graduated from Boston University.</p><p>Together, they shared a son and by 2006, they had started living separately.</p><h3><strong>Matthew Smith Age</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Matthew Smith should be at least 59 years old. Meanwhile, his partner Mike is currently 77 years old.</p><h3><strong>Matthew Smith Job</strong></h3><p>Mattew Smith was reported to be an MBA graduate from Wharton in Pennsylvania. The employees in “Abercrombie & Fitch” referred to him as more approachable than Mike.</p><p>Matthew was initially in charge of The Jeffries Home Office, which managed Mike’s properties and investments, but his responsibilities grew in the years leading up to Mike’s retirement. Since then, Mike and Matthew have kept a low profile, with no new information regarding their relationship or current activities.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Did Matthew Smith Appear On Netflix’s White Hot: The Rise & Fall Of Abercrombie & Fitch?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Matthew Smith hasn’t appeared on Netflix’s White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Ambercombio & Fitch.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Matthew Smith Live Today?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>According to the last reports, Mattew was living with his partner Mike in Ohio.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Matthew Smith On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Matthew Smith doesn’t seem to be on any of the social media platforms including Instagram and Facebook.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpqGbmnqrscWfqaKdo2K9or7Tp5yrZaedvG610makmqyknbK4edKmoK2gXZe2sHnAoJxmop%2BXfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sean-burke-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Burke Net Worth 2024">&larr;
