But ever since they <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke up</a> in 2022, everything is on the table. The exes, who share <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two sons</a>, <strong>Milan</strong>, 10 and <strong>Sasha</strong>, 8, have been <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>publicly shading each other</a> ever since their split. Their relationship reportedly ended because Pique&nbsp;allegedly cheated on Shakira with his now-girlfriend <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Clara Chia Marti</a></strong>, 24. Shakira has moved out of Barcelona, where she and her ex lived during <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship</a>, and has relocated to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Miami, Florida</a> with her kids to get away from Pique.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Shakira and Pique seemed so happy together when they were a couple. But now things are extremely volatile between the singer and the athlete. Here’s the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>full timeline</a> of Shakira and Pique’s relationship, including their happy beginning and their drama-filled breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shakira-Gerard-Pique-Relationship-History-ss-embed-2.jpg><h2>How Long Were Shakira & Pique Together?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Shakira and Pique dated for 11 years. They met back in March 2011 on the set of Shakira’s music video for the World Cup anthem, “Waka Waka (This Time for&nbsp;Africa).” They got involved in a serious relationship that she confirmed with a cozy photo shared to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook</a> in early 2011. Shakira and Pique have both spoken about their first time meeting.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I wasn’t a soccer fan, so I didn’t know who he was,” Shakira said in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2020 interview</a> with 60 Minutes. “When I saw the video, I was like, ‘Hmm, that one’s kind of cute. ‘And then someone decided to introduce us.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pique told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spain’s TV3</a> in 2016, “<span>It all started when we were together in South Africa and I wrote to her. She was already there because she sang in the opening ceremony, and I asked her what the weather was like. It’s the typical stupid question, and the normal answer is to tell me to bring a jacket. But she started telling me what the weather was, like, every minute, and it got to the point where I told her we would have to get to the World Cup final to see her again — she was singing at the final.”</span></p><h2>Were Shakira & Pique Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Shakira and Pique never got married during their 11-year relationship. In 2014, Shakira explained her reason for why the couple didn’t feel the need to become husband and wife. “We already have what’s essential, you know?” she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour</a>.&nbsp;“We have a union, a love for each other, and a baby. I think that those aspects of our relationship are already established, and marriage is not going to change them. But if I’m ever going to get married, he’s the one.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shakira-Gerard-Pique-Relationship-History-ss-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>In her 2020 interview with&nbsp;60 Minutes, Shakira confessed that she’s afraid of marriage. “To tell you the truth, marriage scares the s*** out of me. I don’t want him to see me as the wife. I’d rather him see me as his girlfriend,” the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer said. “His lover, his girlfriend. It’s like a little forbidden fruit, you know? I wanna keep him on his toes,” she added. “I want him to think that anything’s possible depending on his behavior.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Pique told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Overlap</a>&nbsp;in 2022, before the breakup was announced, that he and Shakira didn’t get married because of “her mentality.” The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>retired soccer player</a> added, “I like it how we are right now. We have two kids, nine and seven, we work good as a couple. We don’t have the need to be married, it’s fine.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>While they didn’t get married, Shakira and Pique did grow their family with the additions of two sons. They welcomed their first child <strong>Milan</strong> on January 22, 2013. Their second child&nbsp;<strong>Sasha</strong> was born on January 29, 2015. Shakira and Pique raised their boys in Barcelona, though they regularly traveled to the U.S. with them.</p><h2>Why Did Shakira & Pique Break Up?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Shakira and Pique <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced their split</a> on June 4, 2022. “We regret to confirm that we are separating,” the pair said in a statement released by Shakira’s public relations firm. “For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect our privacy. Thank you for your understanding,” they added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Rumors of the impending split were out there after the Spanish news outlet <a tabindex=0 href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-t='{"n":"destination","t":13,"b":1,"c.t":7}' data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>El Periodico </a>reported Pique had left the family home in Barcelona and was living by himself. Shakira’s single “Te Felecito” seemingly fanned the speculation as well, as the lyrics included, “For completing you I broke into pieces/They warned me, but I did not pay attention. Do not tell me you’re sorry, that seems sincere, but I know you well and I know you lie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shakira-Gerard-Pique-Relationship-History-ss-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>It’s been reported that Pique cheated on Shakira with Clara Chia Marti when they were together, which apparently caused the breakup. Shakira <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>has shaded Clara</a> several times since the split. She released a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>diss track</a> called “BZRP Music Sessions #53”, where the singer refers to Clara as her “supposed replacement.” During an interview with Canal Estrellas, Shakira said, “There is a place in hell reserved for women who don’t support other women.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Shakira opened up about her separation from Pique for the first time in a September 2022 interview with&nbsp;Elle. She admitted to being in the<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “darkest hour of my life.”</a> She also said, “This is really hard to talk about personally, especially as this is the first time I’ve ever addressed this situation in an interview. I’ve remained quiet and just tried to process it all. It’s hard to talk about it, especially because I’m still going through it,” she said, adding that the separation is “not like a regular separation” because of both of their immense fame.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Pique <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke his silence</a> on the split in a March 2023 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>El Pais</a>. “Everyone has their responsibility to try to do what is best for their children,” the dad-of-two said. “It is about protecting them. That is the job of all parents with children. That is what I am focused on and that is my job as a father.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Shakira and Pique reached a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>custody agreement</a> on December 1, 2022. They reportedly agreed that Shakira could<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> move to Miami, Florida,</a> where her maternal family lives, with the boys. The exes said in a joint statement after the custody agreement was finalized, “Our sole objective is to provide our children with the utmost security and protection and hope that they can continue with their lives in a safe and calm environment. We appreciate that their privacy will be respected.”</p><h2>Who Are Shakira & Pique With Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shakira-Gerard-Pique-Relationship-History-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Pique is in a full-fledged relationship with Clara following his split from Shakira. The athlete went&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram official</a> with Clara — an advertising and public relations professional — in January 2023. He shared a cozy selfie of himself and Clara without a caption. In his interview with&nbsp;El Pais, Pique said he’s “very happy” amidst his new relationship. “I keep doing what I want,” Pique said. “The day I die, I will look back and hope I have always done what I wanted. I want to be faithful to myself. I’m not going to spend money cleaning up my image.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Shakira, meanwhile, has been hanging out with race car driver <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong></a>, 38, and they are reportedly in the “early stages” of a budding romance, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “They’re spending time together and in the ‘getting to know you’ stage,” a source told the publication, adding, “It’s fun and flirty.” The “She Wolf” hitmaker and the Formula One driver first sparked <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romance rumors</a> after they were spotted enjoying a day out at sea in Miami on May 10. They were later seen grabbing <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dinner with friends</a> in Spain on June 4. Shakira was also linked to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a>, 60, when they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted hanging out</a> at the Grand Prix on May 7. Shakira has yet to confirm her relationship status amidst her potential new romance with Lewis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KhmKShopZ6sbXQrpxmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsGqucSloKedXWp%2Bc4GQcm5o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-brett-fulton-everything-on-bob-fulton-son.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Brett Fulton?
