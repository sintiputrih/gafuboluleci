Following the season, he opted out of his contract.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>There were suspicions that he was being blackballed by NFL owners, potentially due to the attention his signing would attract. He has not played professionally since the 49ers’ final game of that season.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Legal Battle with the NFL</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>In October 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing its 32 teams of colluding to keep him out of the league.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This legal battle continued for several years, eventually resulting in a settlement between Kaepernick and the NFL in February 2019.

His pursuit of opportunities outside the NFL indicates a willingness to continue his football career, but the challenges of finding a suitable opportunity persist.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact of Activism</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kaepernick's activism and the impact of his public image on his football career have raised questions about the intersection of sports and social issues.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The debate surrounding his status in professional football reflects broader discussions about activism in sports and its implications for athletes.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ultimately, Colin Kaepernick's absence from the NFL and his pursuit of opportunities in other leagues reflect the complex interplay between sports, activism, and public image.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>His journey has sparked national conversations about social justice, civil rights, and the role of athletes in advocating for change.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The reasons for Colin Kaepernick's absence from the UFL and his pursuit of opportunities in other leagues underscore the broader societal and cultural implications of activism in sports, as well as the complexities of navigating professional athletic careers in the context of social advocacy and public image.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfrLW6ecispa1lk6S5qrqMpJieqJWnu6qvymagp2WknbJuwcWl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./auden-larratt-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Auden Larratt Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
