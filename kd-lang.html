Whereas when you cover a song you can create your own reason why you’re attached to it.”&nbsp;<strong>– K. D. Lang</strong></p><p>“Country music was a part of my life. Now it isn’t. We had a good relationship, really, but we wanted each other at arm’s length. The people in Nashville didn’t want to be responsible for my looks or my actions. But they sure did like the listeners I brought.”&nbsp;<strong>– K. D. Lang</strong></p><p>“I like the music. I don’t like the business. Get very tired of the travel and moving, constantly moving. But the hour-and-a-half that I’m making music, I’m one of the happiest people on earth.”&nbsp;<strong>– K. D. Lang</strong></p><p>“I think I don’t swing as hard as I used to sing. I used to kind of hit the accelerator a lot back in my youth, but now it’s just being able to control it, and not work it so hard and use more of an emotional or subtextual kind of approach to singing.”&nbsp;<strong>– K. D. Lang</strong></p><p>“I started singing when I was five. I grew up the youngest of four kids who all studied classical piano, so you could say I’ve been listening to music ever since the moment of conception.”&nbsp;<strong>– K. D. Lang</strong></p><p>“I think I have allowed my voice to experiment with the different genres. And I think that I have just really enjoyed the journey of getting to know my voice and seeing what it’s capable of, what it’s not capable of.”&nbsp;<strong>– K. D.
