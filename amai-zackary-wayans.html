They did, however, have an abundance of love, which carried them through the difficult times they faced.</p><p>After eight years of dating, the couple welcomed their first child, Amai, in 2000. In 2002, they welcomed their second child, a son named Shawn Howell Wayans. For several years, the couple provided a wonderful home life for their children, and many people assumed they were a married couple. This was not the case.</p><p>Though Marlon Wayans has referred to Angela Zackary as his ex-wife, and some media outlets claim that they married in 2005, he and Angela never married. In 2021, the actor-comedian revealed that on his mother’s deathbed, he confessed to her that he had never married because he wanted her to be the number one girl in his life without any other woman coming between them.</p><h2>Amai Zackary Wayans Parents Divorce</h2><p>They divorced in 2013, but they remain good friends to this day. Amai’s parents were married for 21 years before divorcing in 2013. The reason for the breakup is unknown, but it upset Amai, who was only 13 years old at the time. It was a difficult reality for her to face as a teen, but her parents tried to soften the blow by pursuing amicable co-parenting.</p><p>Even after that, they remained genuine friends, which they have maintained over the years. For example, Marlon Wayans sent Angela a wonderful birthday tribute in 2018, describing her as a wonderful soul, sweet, real, and smart. He also described her as a God-given blessing and expressed gratitude not only for their years together but also for their friendship.</p><p>Marlon Wayans and Angela Zackary have a great exes relationship, which has benefited their children. The couple does not argue over joint parental decisions but instead works together to do what is best for their children. This has been extremely beneficial to Amai.</p><h2>Marlon Wayans’ daughter</h2><p>Amai Zackary Wayans grew up in a happy family thanks to her parents. Her parents lavished her with the finer things in life, and she relished them. She accompanied her parents and brother to several movie premieres on the red carpet. Amai’s parents, on the other hand, took precautions to protect her privacy from unwanted intrusions.</p><p>This was done to ensure that she lived as normal a life as possible, so she went to school with other kids. In 2018, she received her high school diploma. In 2018, Amai Zackary Wayans enrolled at the University of Southern California’s College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences.</p><p>She spent four years there, displaying exceptional brilliance. As a result, she was named to the prestigious dean’s list in her sophomore year of 2019. Amai graduated from college in 2022 and is now forging her own path in life. It’s unclear what she does for a living.</p><p>Amai Zackary Wayans could work for a corporation or run her own business. There is also the possibility that she is involved in show business in some capacity. Whatever the case may be, Amai will make a decent living.</p><h2>Amai Zackary Wayans Came Out As A Gay</h2><p><strong>Amai Zackary Wayans</strong> prefers to live her life away from the limelight. She does not have any social media accounts under her given name. Her red carpet appearances are also infrequent. This makes learning about her love life difficult.</p><p>But one thing she has revealed is that she is gay. Around 2020, Amai came out as gay, and her family supported her. Her father was also encouraging. He posted a photo of her wearing rainbow-colored shoes and called her his pride and joy.</p><p>He also stated that there was nothing he would change about her. Some trolls chastised Marlon Wayans for his remarks, but he insisted that he would not change anything about his daughter. He also stated that he loved her for who she was rather than what he desired her to be.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYppmZYseir8qaqbJlp5bGorrSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zach-edey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zach Edey- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts">&larr;
