After finding success as an actress, Locklear's life hit a few road bumps, but at 61, she has managed to get back on her feet after facing a number of setbacks.</p><p class=dh>In 1986, Locklear married her first husband, musician Tommy Lee, but the union sadly didn't last. The pair were married for almost ten years when they decided to go their separate ways in 1993. A year later, Locklear remarried and spent more than a decade with her second husband, Richie Sambora until they divorced in 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7b225a2b1586f83030afa481ec7358953d711fdafeda723562bcf57dcf2b569b.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Heather Locklear in Century City, California, in 1999 | Source: Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e2432c4926b307f86e027f9d4e63dc9d84954a67a7a42c29ef0b05649cb775a4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tommy Lee and Heather Locklear in Los Angeles, 1989 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Locklear and Sambora also shared a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000181/bio/>daughter</a> — the actress's only child, Ava Sambora.

In court, the actress pled guilty to eight misdemeanors.</p><p class=dh>Luckily, the judge ruled that Locklear wouldn't get a 120-day jail sentence, opting instead for a 30-day stay in a residential mental health facility.
