If the carburetor has been thoroughly cleaned, there is no need for any type of gasket sealer in ANY location. Check for small bits of old gaskets (especially if a gasket sealer has been used in the past), small bits of rust, dirt, and other such things if the surfaces are not perfectly flat.
Do carburetor gaskets, on the other hand, require sealant? Because of the studs on the manifold, it may not be necessary to replace the carburetor gasket, but it can’t hurt.</description></item><item><title>Edward Banayoti</title><link>/edward-banayoti.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/edward-banayoti.html</guid><description>Edward Banayoti estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles &amp;amp; many more details have been updated below.
