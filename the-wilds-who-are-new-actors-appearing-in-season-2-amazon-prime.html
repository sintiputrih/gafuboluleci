The platform offers its viewers a wide range of films and television shows such as <a href=#>action-packed dramas</a> and <a href=#>funny unique sitcoms</a>. Its latest release saw one of their well-performing Prime Originals, The Wilds, return for an even more mystery-filled and explosive second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rainn Wilson And John Cusack Are Not The Only Reasons To Watch Amazon Prime's 'Utopia'</a></span></p><p>Season 1 of the show introduced fans to a group of 8 teenage girls who survive a plane crash after being signed on to a wilderness retreat. However, as the season progresses, the show shocks viewers by revealing that nothing was what it seemed and that the girls were, in fact, unknowingly participating in a study designed to study female behavior in tense survival situations. By the end of season 1 of The Wilds, viewers found out that the group of girls was not the only one stranded on an island for survival, but actually, there had also been a study of a group of teenage boys. In the run-up to season 2, many of the <a href=#>original cast members spoke up about this</a> and teased the new characters and storylines. So who are these new members joining the survival drama? Let's take a look at the new faces that are joining season 2 of The Wilds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zack-calderon-as-rafael-garcia><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Zack Calderon As Rafael Garcia</span></h2><p>Coming in first we have the young breakthrough star, Zack Calderon. The 22-year-old actor seems to be at the start of his career having only just appeared in the 2018 Craig Turk series FBI as Daniel Garcia. In the second season of the young adult survival drama, Calderon portrays the character of Rafael Garcia. According to Deadline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Calderon’s Rafael is a “quiet, sensitive teenager who lives in Tijuana</a> but attends high school in San Diego.” Fans can expect to see his character struggle with the concept of dual identity and perhaps see him struggle to exert strength and leadership throughout the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adrian-laprete-as-henry-tanaka><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Adrian Laprete As Henry Tanaka</span></h2><p>Up next, we have Hawaiian-born singer and songwriter Adrian Laprete. The 20-year-old musical star first made his big break in the acting industry way back in 2010 when he appeared on an episode of Hawaii Five-0. Since then, the young star has gone on to acquire several small and supporting roles in short films, TV shows, and music videos. Prior to joining The Wilds, Laprete had also built a pretty established musical career, having worked with some pretty big names such as Train and Jack Johnson and even releasing his own EP’s and album. In The Wilds, Laprete portrays the character of Henry Tanaka who, according to the Deadline article, is an “emo reclusive type who prefers to retreat into the safety of his noise-canceling headphones and dwell on the darkness in the world”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Is Amazon Prime's 'Small Axe' Film Series Related To Bob Marley?</a></span></p><h2 id=nicholas-coombe-as-josh-herbert><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nicholas Coombe As Josh Herbert</span></h2><p>One actor who will be joining the cast with a few credits under his belt is Nicholas Coombe. Much like Laprete, the 27-year-old actor had already had an established acting career prior to joining the cast of the Amazon Prime drama. Coombe’s most recognizable roles are those in Dora And The Lost City Of Gold as Randy, Spy Kids: Mission Critical as Ace, and 68 Whiskey as Anthony Petrocelli. In The Wilds, Coombe portrays the role of Josh Herbert, a wealthy teen with awkward tendencies and high levels of stress who carries a “suitcase filled with meds”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charles-alexander-as-kirin-o-rsquo-conner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Charles Alexander As Kirin O’Conner</span></h2><p>Coming in next we have 23-year-old actor Charles Alexander. Prior to joining the cast of The Wilds, Alexander showed his multi-faceted skills as he wrote, directed, and starred in his own short 2020 film, Mother Dearest. In the survival drama, Alexander portrays the character of Kirin O’Conner, an alpha-style jock with a no-nonsense attitude. Whilst speaking to The List about his character, Alexander noted how he had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made sure to stray away from the “typical macho leader”</a> and made sure to add his own unique style to the role.</p><p>Alexander stated, “It was fun, because the way he rips into the other, bullies the others, he does it with ... I wanted to inject some humor about it, the way that he says certain things".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-fitzalan-as-seth-novak><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Alex Fitzalan As Seth Novak</span></h2><p>Portraying Laprete’s stepbrother in the show is Alex Fitzalan as Seth Novak. Prior to joining The Wilds, Fitzalan was a part of several short films and podcast series. His most notable film and television roles include Harry Bingham in Netflix’s The Society and Tom in the 2018 horror film, Slender Man. In The Wilds, Fitzalan portrays the character of Seth Novak, Henry’s (Laprete) “polar opposite” stepbrother who, according to the official Wilds Instagram page, “seems to be a calm guy” and a “self-appointed people pleaser”. Whilst speaking to The List beside Alexander, the young actor revealed how much he had enjoyed playing his character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fitzalan stated, “It was great. It's an interesting character to play because the first half of the season is quite light ... He was a leader-type character, I suppose.”</p><h2 id=miles-gutierrez-riley-as-ivan-taylor><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Miles Gutierrez-Riley As Ivan Taylor</span></h2><p>Coming in next we have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OG cast member Mia Healey’s BFF,</a> Miles Gutierrez-Riley. The young actor’s role in the Amazon Prime drama will see Gutierrez-Riley in his debut on-screen role. In the show, the LA-born actor portrays the character of Ivan Taylor, a young activist who will be bringing some harsh truths and even harsher words for the stranded group of boys due to his nature of being “unapologetically himself”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Amazon Prime Leaves Awkward Comment On Billie Eilish's Instagram</a></span></p><h2 id=reed-shannon-as-scotty-simms><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Reed Shannon As Scotty Simms</span></h2><p>Another actor joining The Wilds with an already well-established acting career behind him is Reed Shannon. Prior to his role in the survival drama, Shannon formed part of many television shows. Most notably the young actor voiced the character of Ekko in 2021’s Arcane series. In The Wilds, Shannon portrays the role of Scotty Simms who will be bringing a big personality and presence to the group of stranded boys.</p><h2 id=tanner-ray-rook-as-bo-leonard><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tanner Ray Rook As Bo Leonard</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And finally, the last member joining the unknowing group of stranded teenage boys is Tanner Ray Book. Prior to his role in The Wilds season 2, Rook only had one other acting credit to his name. His previous on-screen role was that of Goblin in the first episode of 2019’s Side Quest. In the Amazon Prime drama, Rook portrays the character of Bo Leonard, Scotty’s (Shannon) best friend with a heart of gold who, according to the Instagram account of the show, is “the product of a strict upbringing”.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Haley Grable, Star Of 'Tampa Baes' On Amazon Prime?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1drLatsNJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnNnq5mmZOpvLO%2FjJqnqZ2Rp7avs4yipWarlZbAsLqMa2SapZGvvK95z6ugpp1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-jessen-wine-90-day-fiance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="We're Extremely Jealous of '90 Day Fianc' Star Michael Jessen's Job">&larr;
