Caleb Prior is a member of Erudite faction. He was born in Abnegation to Andrew and Natalie Prior. He is the <b>older brother of Tris</b> by less than a year, as the two take the Choosing Ceremony at the same time.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-natalie-prior-divergent></span>Is Natalie prior Divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Natalie Prior (née Wright) was the <b>loving mother of Tris and Caleb Prior</b>, and the wife of Andrew Prior. … Natalie was shot to death by the Dauntless soldiers under simulation in Divergent after she rescued her daughter, Tris.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-marlene-divergent></span>Who is Marlene Divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>​​​​Marlene was <b>a Dauntless-born initiate</b>. She befriends Tris Prior in Divergent but plays a more important role in Insurgent. She gets a muffin shot off her head in Divergent, the book.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-tris-called-six></span>Why is Tris called Six?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>This is how Tobias got the nickname “Four”. Tris originally had 7 fears, but later had 6 which included: <b>To be devoured by crows</b> – symbolic of her family turning on her/powerlessness. … Men reaching for her in her Abnegation room – symbolic, scared of death.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=has-allegiant-2-been-cancelled></span>Has Allegiant 2 been Cancelled?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>All projects canceled</b><p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise since there’s been no updates over the past two years, but Lionsgate has now confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Allegiant, Part 2 is no longer in development as a TV show or a movie. It’s as deceased as Tris.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tris-mum-divergent></span>Is Tris mum divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In fact, just like Tris, <b>Natalie Prior is Divergent</b> (35.37). So Tris spent all this time beating herself up for not being like her mom—when, in fact, she’s exactly like her mom, in more ways than she ever imagined.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-lynn-love-marlene-divergent></span>Did Lynn Love Marlene divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Lynn had a close relationship with her siblings Shauna and Hector. … She was also very close with Marlene and Uriah, although she seemed unhappy and bitter when they started a romantic relationship. It was revealed in Insurgent that <b>it was due to the fact she was in love with Marlene</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-peter-divergent-too></span>Is Peter divergent too?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>He is not divergent</b>. … He has shown traits for both Dauntless and Erudite on multiple occasions, which would technically qualify, but since he’s only “20% divergent” (eric was doing tests in the insurgent movie, 2 factions=20% I think but I didn’t actually do the math ecksdee).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-tris-choose-dauntless></span>Why did Tris choose Dauntless?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Tris needed to go to Dauntless. Like she says in the book, she needed to realize that <b>being brave and being selfless were the same thing</b>. Her going to Dauntless helped herself develop into the character I loved. dauntless.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-candor-black-and-white></span>Why is candor black and white?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Candor are serious about their views on honesty against dishonesty. … Their substance in the Choosing Ceremony is glass for its transparency that the very principle of honesty reflects, and they wear black and white clothing <b>because they see the truth as only black and white</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-caleb-a-divergent></span>Is Caleb a divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Caleb is not divergent</b> as he is genetically damaged due to he only got the result for Erudite which was only one third of Tris result in the books but one fifth of hers in the movies. According to the movies he is 63% pure. Which means he is “divergent” but not “normal” aka he is both erudite and abnegation.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-abnegation-called-stiff></span>Why are abnegation called stiff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Abnegations are called ‘Stiffs’ <b>because married couples only touch hands in front of others</b>. They don’t hug each other, so whenever someone tries to hug them, they become stiff.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-assaults-tris></span>Who assaults Tris?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The fact that <b>Peter, Al</b>, and Drew attack Tris right after she overhears Eric’s sinister conversation emphasizes the fact that her Divergence puts her in danger, not just from Erudite or Dauntless authorities, but from her fellow initiates.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-al-feel-about-tris></span>How does Al feel about Tris?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Will may have betrayed Tris while under mind control, but Al doesn’t really have much of an excuse. In a way, that makes his story is straight up tragic: <b>he betrays Tris because he’s frustrated by her</b>. In other words, Al turns out not to be such a good friend when he wants something from her that she can’t give.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-dauntless-wear-black></span>Why do dauntless wear black?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Dauntless are those who are brave, seeming almost fearless. … Members of Dauntless dress in tight-fitting, dark or black clothing that <b>aids in their lifestyle of battle and training</b>.

To get to their base, they jump on and off a train every day.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-color-does-amity-wear-in-divergent></span>What color does Amity wear in divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The people of Amity are often peaceful and kind. Those in Amity wear <b>yellow and red clothing</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-difference-between-amity-and-abnegation></span>What’s the difference between Amity and abnegation?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Abnegation are selfless to a fault</b>, they think about helping others and not being a burden. Amity is about kindness, but it’s more about forgiveness and peace.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-in-the-amity-faction></span>Who is in the Amity faction?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Amity is one of the <b>five factions</b> in the world of Divergent. Members of Amity are dedicated to peacefulness, kindness, forgiveness, trust, self-sufficiency, and neutrality; as such, they are slow to anger and yet quick to forgive. Amity was formed by those who blamed war and fighting for human nature’s faults.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-the-factionless-divergent></span>Who are the Factionless Divergent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“The Factionless, the ones who don’t fit in anywhere.” Factionless is <b>a status in which a person is not welcome into any faction</b>. This is described as being homeless and even worse than death itself because the Factionless have to suffer.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-tris-father-demonstrate-his-bravery></span>How does Tris Father demonstrate his bravery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>How does Tris’ father demonstrate his bravery? <b>He gives his life so Tris can complete the mission</b>.
