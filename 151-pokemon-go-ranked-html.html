But as they wander across America, those <a href=#>new initiates</a> might start to wonder which&nbsp;Pokémon are the most prized. Is it worth it to head toward a Beedrill when a Mankey’s close by? If there’s no Dratini in sight, will a Seadra do in a pinch? To answer all, two Vulture editors put their heads together to come up with a definitive ranking of the 151 Pokémon you <a href=#>may or may not encounter</a> on your quest. We’re not simply evaluating these pocket monsters for their battle ability: style, vibe, and a certain <i><span class=spell>je ne sais quoi</span></i> are just as important.
