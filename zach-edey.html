Zachry, like many other athletes, prefers to keep his early life off social media, therefore little information about his youth exists.</p><p>His most notable game was against Wisconsin in March 2021, when he came off the bench to score a season-high 21 points. He also grabbed seven rebounds in the 73-69 victory. Likewise, he has an average of 8.7 points and 4.4 rebounds as a freshman in college.</p><p>He did, however, remark that he enjoyed baseball, ice hockey, and basketball. The Canadian basketball player is still in the early stages of her profession and hasn’t had much opportunity to showcase her abilities. More is yet to come, and he still has a long way to go.
