In "by tonight," NoCap talks about deep-seated subjects like drugs and crime that are plaguing his life. He goes on about listening to his gangster inner voice to get by, maintaining his grip on truth in a world where lies and deceptions pull individuals down. In the first verse, NoCap communicates how he has demons and guns in his life, and he's attempting to make it out alive, facing hardships head-on. He mentions that he can tell someone has been crying, and he feels guilty for splurging on a designer purchase that didn't fix anything, a clever reference to the fact that money can't buy happiness. In the chorus, the artist sings about having guns in his hand and troops on the front line while making references to Suge Knight, while indicating that his turbulent lifestyle has led him down an obsessive path of expensive watches and having to duck for authorities.</p><br><p>In the second verse, NoCap speaks about drug addiction, how he'd spotted a knot on his head, purportedly from an accidental hard hit when he needed money to fuel his dependence. He then referenced drug usage and how it's often present in low-income areas, including his neighbourhood. He then discusses his doubts about a female, unsure if she's loyal and deceiving him. Finally, the rapper talks about how he typically plays it low-key but is still focused on fame, and his persevering faith that everything will turn out alright.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I got demons in my life, guns on my side</u><br>I have personal struggles and I carry weapons for protection</p><br><p><u>Tryna make it out alive, ayy</u><br>I am trying to survive</p><br><p><u>I can tell she been cryin'</u><br>I can see that she has been upset and emotional</p><br><p><u>I bought the bitch designer, something wasn't right, ayy</u><br>I bought her expensive things, but things didn't feel right between us</p><br><p><u>I can back the troops, my hittas on the front line</u><br>I have loyal friends who are always there for me</p><br><p><u>I told my nigga give me a price, he said love</u><br>I was asking for the cost and my friend replied with an expression of love</p><br><p><u>They gon' be gone by the night like they Suge</u><br>Things will happen quickly and people will disappear like Suge Knight's associates</p><br><p><u>We need a bride for this Glock 'cause we ringin' it out</u><br>We need a girlfriend for the gun as we use it often</p><br><p><u>I bumped my head 'cause that's how bad a nigga needed a knot</u><br>I hurt myself because I needed money so badly</p><br><p><u>Forever put drugs in my body if I need it or not</u><br>I'll keep using drugs to numb my pain, with or without actually needing them</p><br><p><u>The hood was like a dealership, I was leavin' a lot</u><br>I was in and out of the hood so much, it became like a car dealership</p><br><p><u>I asked you did you fuck my nigga?
