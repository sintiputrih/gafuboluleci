The show originally cast 30 singles from Chicago, all of whom expected to leave the pods with their future spouse. Unfortunately, that was not the case for most of them. The show is hosted by the bona fide married duo, Nick and Vanessa Lachey.</p><p><a href=#>The Lachey's have hosted this and other dating shows</a> because of their early relationship experience. They both started in a long-distance relationship and realized that loving a person deals with more than just the physical appearance and distractions from the outside world.</p><p>Out of the 30 singles who happened to be featured on the show, six couples got engaged whilst the others remained singletons. Fans of the show were therefore only privileged to view the blossoming of the relationships of the couples who proposed. But, what happened to the other cast members who did not become fiancés and fiancées?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joey-miller-and-caitlin-mckee-got-cozy-behind-the-scenes><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Joey Miller And Caitlin McKee Got Cozy Behind The Scenes</span></h2><p>The couple, Joey Miller and Caitlin Mckee did not get a chance to have their love story filmed like every other couple whose viewers had a first-row seat.
