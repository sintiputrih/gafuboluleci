As a young school-aged child, Doug was enrolled at George Washington High School from where he graduated before continuing his college education.&nbsp;Douglas enrolled at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia in 2006, where he studied economics.&nbsp;He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 2010.</span></p><p><span>Prior to his graduation, Doug DeMuro began working with Ferrari of Denver as a Customer Service Technician from May to August 2008. Subsequently, he worked with Saturn of Decatur as a Sales Consultant from July to November 2009. Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) became his next work rate as an intern.&nbsp;He worked as a business development intern for dealerships from November 2009 to May 2010. After graduation, he started working in the company as a full-time writer.&nbsp;Then, from May 2010 to December 2011, he worked as an allocation specialist, and from January 2012 to 2013, DeMuro became manager of vehicle allocation at PCNA.</span></p><p><span>His position at the time made him the exclusive authorized dealer for Porsche vehicles in the United States and on top of that he was the direct replacement for PCNA’s Director of Vehicle Distribution, made sales forecasts at retail, managed customer orders for the Porsche 918 Spyder and ensured prompt delivery of the vehicle to customers by working efficiently with field staff.</span></p><p><span>Despite the so rapid increase in PCNA;&nbsp;becoming the company’s youngest ever manager, Doug Demuro decided to quit his job to devote more time to what he loved to do – writing.</span></p><p><span>Douglas became a full-time writer in January 2013, and hasn’t backed down since.&nbsp;He started writing for Jalopnik before creating a series where he bought cars voted by his readers.&nbsp;He normally kept the cars with him for a year before getting another one.&nbsp;The series became what is known today as DougCar.&nbsp;His automotive writing career has seen him write for sites like AutoTrader.com and The Week.&nbsp;He also has two books to his name which are ‘Plays With Cars’ (2013) and ‘Bumper to Bumper’ (2016).&nbsp;The books have sold thousands of copies over the years.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-value></span><strong><span>Net value</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Perhaps the most important thing for Doug DeMuroc now is doing what he loves to do, which is writing.&nbsp;He was able to accumulate an estimated net worth of around $1.5 million.&nbsp;Reports say he earns between $6,000 and $106,000 in a month, however, this has not been verified.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-female></span><strong><span>Family: female</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>While Doug DeMuro was at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia working as a resident counselor, he met a beautiful young woman who caught his eye.&nbsp;The two didn’t start dating but Doug made sure to keep his position as closest friend.&nbsp;This move worked out for him and he married her sometime in 2017 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;The duo later moved to the San Diego metro area and have lived together ever since.</span></p><p><span>In case you are wondering why we avoided mentioning his wife’s name, the above information is all there is to know about the writer’s wife.&nbsp;His name and other details of his identity remain a closely guarded secret by Doug.&nbsp;Due to Doug’s need for privacy, it is unknown whether or not they had children.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-facts></span><strong><span>Height and other facts</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong><span>the size</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Doug DeMuro stands at a height of 6 feet 3 inches or 1.90m.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Cars by Doug DeMuro</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Some of the cars the author has owned include 1996 Volvo 850 Turbo sedan, 2001 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (W210), 2006 Lotus Elise, 2011 Cadillac CTS-V station wagon, 2012 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG (W212) station wagon among others.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Television career</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>His knowledge of cars earned him a TV appearance when he was seen on&nbsp;</span><span>Jay Leno’s Garage</span><span>&nbsp;with TV host Jay Leno in 2017.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfqrRusMSmrKunXZe2sLPRmqehsV2stqexjLCgpKFdlrSmec2eq2avn6fBqXnHnqCgoKRivLW0xKtkn5mTqcBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ikenna-ekwonna-bio-parents-height-job-love-island-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Love Island's Ikenna Ekwonna!
