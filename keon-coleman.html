His dedication to Michigan State Football and Michigan State Basketball, likewise, have probably increased his net worth. So, how much cash does he have on hand?</p><p>Coleman’s earnings and net worth are currently being investigated, so no more information on the subject can be released. Despite this, the average annual wage for a college basketball and football player is $33,487, with some players making up to<strong> $50,500.</strong></p><h2>Early Years and childhood</h2><p>Keon Coleman was born and reared in Louisiana’s Opelousas suburbs.

According to the scant information available about his family, his parents are very supportive, and he has brothers and sisters. According to accounts, he also graduated from Opelousas Catholic School in high school.</p><h2>Professional life and career</h2><p>Basketball and football have been a part of the two-sport star’s life since he was a child. He pursued his interest even in high school, participating in both sports at the same time. His enthusiasm in both sports grew over time, and he decided to focus on improving his game rather than switching sports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Keon-Coleman-career-The-Daily-Advertiser.jpg><p>Soon after, he began playing basketball for his high school team. Before he graduated, he had outstanding numbers, averaging 33 points each game. After that, he played basketball with the Minnesota Vikings for a few seasons.
