The "Thotiana" rapper's OnlyFans-based reality television show garnered quite a lot of fans, and in it, viewers were exposed to some of the most intimate details of the star's romantic life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Blueface emerged from the drama of the show with Chrisean as his girlfriend. So, what do we know about the <a href=#>timeline of their relationship</a> after that?

Breaking down their relationship timeline.</h2><p>The genesis of Blueface and Chrisean's relationship can be traced back to 2020 when she was introduced as a competitor on his OnlyFans reality show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Girls Club</a>. In the series, a group of women were invited to live in Blueface's home for a month and attempt to compete for his affection.</p><p>Chrisean — a track and field star from Baltimore, Md., with 11 siblings, a then-incarcerated father, and a drug-addicted mother, per an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Baltimore</a> — stood out immediately to viewers for her no-nonsense attitude and apparent love for Blueface.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She even got into a physical altercation with Jaidyn Alexis, Blueface's baby mama, where her tooth was knocked out. Blueface was impressed by Chrisean and decided to select her as the winner and sign her to his record label, Blueface LLC.</p><p>Shortly after that, Chrisean released a song with Blueface called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Lonely"</a> that drove plenty of attention to her music career and social media handles, which exploded with new followers.</p><p>While this was happening, Blueface and Chrisean's love grew deeper and more profound, with the latter opting to tattoo homages to Blueface on her seven times, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shade Room</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Things began to get a little shaky shortly after that. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox23 News</a>, Chrisean was arrested in Oklahoma on Valentine’s Day 2022 after stealing Blueface’s car. Despite this, the duo remained an item when Chrisean was released.</p><p>This was far from the last time that the couple had run-ins with the law while together, though.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shade Room</a>, Chrisean admitted to hitting Blueface's mother and sister during an altercation in May 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that Chrisean was arrested in August 2022 for criminal trespassing in Phoenix, Ariz. Initial rumors were that the two got into a fight, but Blueface denied them.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueface then got into a physical altercation</a> with Chrisean's father in September 2022 after the latter punched him, causing the rapper to retaliate with his own blows.</p><p>Then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueface was arrested</a> in Las Vegas in October 2022 for felony attempted murder with the use of a deadly firearm or tear gas.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Also in October 2022, Chrisean made claims that Blueface struck her, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. She later rescinded her statement and stated that she was on "a bad trip" and Blueface actually rescued her at the time.</p><p>Another instance of Blueface and Chrisean getting into it came by way of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">January 2023 episode</a> of Crazy in Love, which the couple stars in. In it, Chrisean can be seen mending a head injury after allegedly striking Blueface with a Hennessy bottle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The episode appeared to have been filmed some time earlier, and by the looks of Blueface's Jan. 9, 2023, Twitter post which read, "I love when I spot a mf who said me an Rock doing a show was a bad idea but they watching the show full circle," as well as images on social media at the time, it seemed as though Blue and Chrisean were still going strong. But by the summer, they were said to be broken up amid Chrisean's pregnancy with Blueface's baby.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, Jaidyn (who Blueface had also assigned to M.I.L.F. earlier in the year) was none too pleased to see her ex and baby daddy back with Chrisean, and a battle on Twitter ensued. The embeds below are just a small snippet of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">much longer war of words</a>, which included Jaidyn referring to Blueface as a "narcissist, a liar, and a weirdo."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I signed both my baby mommas I guess I’m the problem</p>— blueface (@bluefacebleedem) <a href=#>September 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Chrisean later took to Twitter to address the drama that had been unfolding, and explained that she and Blueface had come to a sort of peace — and that she hoped Jaidyn would do the same.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Chrisean also clarified that she and Blueface were not back together romantically, but were working together to raise their son and "heal properly and become best friends again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Only time will tell what comes next for the Chrisean and Blueface, but one thing is for certain: Fans will be watching and waiting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7m2scWamp5lk52%2Fqr%2FEmqVmqp%2BYuG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7E%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./flip-gordon-backstage-double-or-nothing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Flip Gordon Surprises AEW Stars Backstage at Double or Nothing (VIDEO)">&larr;
