Her full name is Diane Eve Warren. Her father’s name was David Wolfberg, but he changed it into David Warren because it, ‘Wolfberg,’ sounded a Jewish name. Her father was an insurance salesman while her mother, Flora Warren, was probably a homemaker.</p><p>She is the youngest of her other two sisters. Being a Jew kid, Diane felt alienated as a child. There is not any confirmed information about her early education.

As a teenager, she approached many publishers but ended up with a flat no from everywhere.</p><p>Nevertheless, she didn’t lose hope and kept writing the songs. Finally, in 1983, she found a helping hand of producer Jack White, who signed a deal with her.

The company has all the right to her songs. Over her entire career, she has written more than 1000 songs for many star artists and big production companies.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-achievements></span>Awards & achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Diane Warren has won several awards and nominations throughout her career.
