She disappeared in 1994, leaving behind her husband and two young children. Patricia was found living under an assumed name, and her husband, Bob Kopta, expressed his relief that she had been found alive. Bob had never remarried, and the discovery that Patricia was still alive after all these years has left him feeling overjoyed. It is not yet clear what led Patricia to disappear or what she has been doing for the past 30 years, but the important thing is that she has been found and is alive. This discovery is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of hope in the face of uncertainty.</p><p><a class=ahreftag-styles href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/ShelbyCassesse/status/1631370896374898692</a></p><h2 id=what_happened_to_patricia_kopta class=smooth-goto>What happened to Patricia kopta?</h2><p>The discovery of Patricia Kopta, a missing woman from Pittsburgh who had been gone for almost three decades, has shocked the world. Patricia was found living under an assumed name in Puerto Rico, and her husband and family are overjoyed that she has been found alive. The discovery raises many questions about why Patricia disappeared and what she has been doing for the past 30 years, but for now, her family is just grateful to know that she is safe. The case highlights the importance of never giving up hope and never forgetting those who have gone missing, even after many years. The fact that Patricia has been found alive after so long is a testament to the power of perseverance and the resilience of the human spirit. We can only hope that this discovery will bring some closure to Patricia’s loved ones and that she will be able to reunite with her family after all these years.</p><h2 id=who_is_patricia_kopta class=smooth-goto>Who is Patricia Kopta?</h2><p>Patricia Kopta, also known as ‘The Sparrow,’ used to live in Pennsylvania and was a well-known street preacher in her town. She earned her nickname from local residents. The Ross Township police reported that in 1999, Patricia was discovered in need of care and was taken to an adult care home where she was later diagnosed with dementia. Patricia refused to share any details about her life with the staff at the care home until her condition progressed, and she began to open up. Her husband, Bob Kopta, and her sister, Gloria Smith, expressed immense gratitude upon discovering that Patricia was found alive after 31 years. Bob shared that Patricia enjoyed ballroom dancing and worked as an elevator operator before her disappearance. The couple did not have any children together, and Patricia was a devout Roman Catholic whose religious fervor only grew stronger with time. She eventually claimed to be the mother of God and warned of a nuclear Armageddon. Patricia lost her job and spent her days warning people on the streets and in parking lots about the end of the world, which further cemented her nickname, ‘The Sparrow.’</p><h2 id=patricia_kopta_missing_person class=smooth-goto>Patricia Kopta Missing Person</h2><p>A woman who had been missing for 31 years and presumed dead has been found alive in Puerto Rico.
